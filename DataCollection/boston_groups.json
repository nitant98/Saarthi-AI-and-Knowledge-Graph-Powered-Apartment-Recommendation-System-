No worries, we'll have plenty to choose from, like, \"When are you the happiest?\" and, \"If you were going to become close friends with me, what would I need to know about you?\" We'll give you ground rules to make sure you feel comfortable and safe sharing as much of yourself as possible while still feeling in complete control of how much you divulge.",

While our sports leagues have gone by many different names across the country, we never sacrifice a fun and high quality experience. Through sport, we build relationships, find out what drives us, and have fun along the journey. We strive to create the opportunity for a fulfilled life through genuine communities and access to activity. In 2015, we started the Volo Kids Foundation, as a way to support our local communities and get kids more active. Since that time, we have served over 12,800 kids, and part of every registration goes toward supporting our foundation\u2019s mission.",

They are called screenings and are free.\nThese movies are usually screened Mon. to Thur. 7 PM.\u00a0 Members are required to get in line starting at 5 PM but should be in line before 6.\u00a0 These times depend on the movies appeal.\u00a0 Seats are not guaranteed since they overbook to assure a full house.\nThis may not work for all people with jobs and or may have to travel to the theater screening the movie.\n\nFriendships will develop over time while waiting in line and than after being seated waiting for the movie to start. After the movie may want to do something with a new friend or friends and than you get to be the first to blog about it on your Facebook page or Tweet it to your followers or any social group your into.\nPlease use your full name when signing up or at least a last initial with your first name if your afraid of stalkers.\u00a0 It helps when I need to search for members.\u00a0 Also your join date helps for me to find you.\n\nTo cover costs to run this group we had to require a $5. yearly fee.\u00a0 New members have 30 days to decide if they like the group and want to remain a member.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Twitter account is mostly for spreading the word of injustices and political stuff.\n\n<a>Follow @tommyboy0690\\</a>\n\\\n\nTom",

Our focus is on creating a robust community where founders of tech startups and service-based businesses\u2014such as marketing agencies, law firms, and development shops\u2014can come together. We prioritize a supportive environment where experiences and \"war stories\" are shared, not sold.

Members found violating this policy are promptly removed.\n\nWe commit to fostering a safe space under the Chatham House Rule, allowing founders to openly discuss their challenges and celebrate their victories without the fear of external judgment. This rule enhances our community's integrity, encouraging honest and helpful exchanges. Boston Founders is not just a network; it\u2019s a sanctuary for founders to support and inspire one another amidst the highs and lows of entrepreneurial leadership.\n\nBe sure to join our Discord to keep the conversation going outside of our events: https://discord.gg/Gy53wXZh",

        "description": "On behalf of Boston Fun Run, I (Brian) would like to personally welcome you to our group! The general premise is pretty straightforward, we're a group that likes to run and have fun!\n\nOdds are if you are reading this, you are considering joining or new to the group. So, again welcome. I think it's worth pointing out, all the current hosts of this group are not original members. So we were just like you once upon a time, taking a leap of faith to join what is hopefully a fun group. I'm a bit biased but I think we're pretty awesome. Let me explain...\n\nThe main event is our Run & Chug. We meet every Wednesday, 7:00 p.m. at a different bar in Boston, go for a run and then meet back at the bar. This is a great way to discovery the city if you are new in town. In fact, this is how I learned my way around Boston when I first moved here.\n\nReasons to join this group: \n\n* If you're in your 20-30's (or just think you can hang) with a fun personality looking to meet new people.\n* Training for that first (or next) big run.\n* Just starting or re-starting to get into running.\n* Like exploring bars/breweries throughout Boston & Cambridge (we try to keep all events easily accessible via the T). Meaning you don't even have to like running to join us!\n* Wednesday night consistency! Aside from really really crummy weather (but we WILL run in the snow) and that 2020 \"event\", we'll host a Run & Chug. Sometimes folks just run or just chug, but you'll always know where your friends are on Wednesday night.\n\n\nReasons to **not** join this group:\n\n* If you are a hardcore serious runner who is gonna judge everyone's running ability and form. \n* Looking for something more than casual runs & evening social events.\n\n\nAgain, all running paces are welcome. We have all running speeds and abilities, so I'm confident everyone can find someone in the group to run with each week. The emphasis is on making it back to the bar! So, whether you're new to the city or just want to escape the humdrum of everyday life, these Wednesday runs are a great way to unplug!\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out to myself (Brian), Jackie, or Sergiu. Cheers!!\n\nP.S. we got friends all over the US, check out our other locations:\nSan Francisco: [http://www.meetup.com/SF-Fun-Run/](http://www.meetup.com/SF-Fun-Run/)\nNew York: [http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Fun-Run/](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Fun-Run/)\nPortland: [http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Fun-Run/](http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Fun-Run/)\nPhiladelphia: [http://www.meetup.com/Philly-Fun-Run/](http://www.meetup.com/Philly-Fun-Run/)\nSan Diego: [http://www.meetup.com/SD-Fun-Run/](http://www.meetup.com/SD-Fun-Run/)",

Never stop moving**.\n\n\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e00\u751f\u4e4b\u8ba1\u3002\u6c38\u4e0d\u653e\u5f03\uff0c\u6c38\u4e0d\u505c\u6b65\u3002\n\nThe BMCL Meetup Group was founded on May 5, 2003. We are a Mandarin Chinese conversation practice group, for all levels. The group is open and self-led. When we run out of vocabulary, we chat about China in English :) Welcome native speakers who would like to meet conversation partners, or lead activities.\n\n**Attending our meetups**\nWe organize meetups to help people practice Mandarin Chinese and English language. A crucial part of the language learning process is interacting with other people. Books and computers and apps cannot take the place of real, live human interaction.\n**Please come prepared to practice and receive feedback on your target language: either Mandarin or English.** Native speakers of each will be in attendance to help us learn. Each attendee is invited to bring an icebreaker question to help spark conversation.\n\n**No-shows**\nIf you sign up for an event, please show up. If you have a schedule change and can't make it, please change your RSVP to \"Not going\". All no-shows at Mandarin Conversation Practice and Discussion Group events since April 20th, 2022 have been marked as such, so the attendee lists all reflect actual attendance.\n\n**Member Profiles**\nReturning members please log in to your member profile on a computer by going to our [Group page](https://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/). Look for the \"You're a member\" drop down menu next to the main toolbar with \"About, Events, Members...\" Please update your information and tell us where you are currently based, which time periods on which days of the week you are likely to be able to attend events, and what kind of meetups you would like us to organize.\n\n**Members**\nMany of our members live in Massachusetts. Some live in other parts of the US. Some are in the Boston area for brief time periods. In the age of Online Meetups, you do not need to physically be in Boston to take part in our events. Once you have joined our meetup group and taken part in our events, you're always welcome to pop in and catch up with your friends, be it online, or at in-person meetups. Please remember to visit the group meetup page occasionally and update your profile details. Members will not be deleted just because they are not residing in MA.\n\n**Joining the meetup group**\nTo be a member of this group you need to have a profile photo recognizable as you. This helps people recognize each other at meetups. This is required for all new members joining after May 2022. Please have a look at recent event descriptions. Join if you feel that these are the types of events you would like to take part in.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Original [About the Group piece by Reece](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1htZ7FQGQSvenN5mEY21qbROyKWM1e6BidoKepnLq6EQ/edit#gid=23864094)\n* Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group Pages previously uploaded by our Organizers and Members.

        "urlname": "bostontraumasurvivorgroup",
        "description": "We are a group for people who have suffered or are suffering from Narcissistic Abuse in a love or personal relationship. We will discuss and encourage sharing of our experiences, talk about trauma bonding and how to break the cycle. Most importantly, we will share our communal experience and provide support by listening and sharing our what we've gone through so that all attendees know that they are not alone.\n\nPlease read this message carefully: Before signing up to any meeting in this group, you MUST attend a First Timers Meeting event. There are NO exceptions to this. These meetings are designed to ensure community safety and if you sign up for an Established Member event without attending one, you will be removed from that event. Before you do anything else, including signing up for an Established Members group, check out our \"Events\" section and sign up for a First Timers Group and attend one BEFORE you sign up for an Established Member meeting. We are very strict about this rule, so please do so as we hate to remove people from meetings and have to send a PM advising someone of this rule.\n\nAll meetings are run through Zoom. The links and passwords are reset every day. The links are all sent the morning of the meetings. You will receive your link through whatever email you use through Meetup. Please ensure you have your settings with Meetup set to receive emails as they will come in through that email. If you sign up for a meeting, please check you have received your link well before the meeting as we do not check our emails during meetings. It is your responsibility to check that you have received your link - if you haven't received it and it's before meeting time, simply send your organizer a PM and we will ensure you receive it.\nSome more general rules that will be reviewed in your First Timer's Meeting:\n\n1. DO NOT private message moderators/organizers unless you have a question regarding the group as a whole, or you didn't receive a link to the meeting. DO NOT message us for medical, legal, or general advice, and do not contact us to vent. We understand that times are tough and this is not an easy situation to deal with, but we are all running this group on a volunteer basis, and we do not have any medical or counseling degrees. If there is an emergency please call 911, contact your local police, hospital, or physician. There is also a domestic violence hotline (800.799.SAFE) and a suicide hotline (800-273-8255) - these are free 24 hour services. We appreciate your understanding in advance.\n2. DO NOT private message other members of the group. Again, this is an exception to the rule above, but if you see someone in a meeting you'd like to reach out to, please send the organizer of that meeting a message and we will ask that person if they consent to being contacted and will pass on your info to them. If a member tells you during a meeting to reach out to them, that is OK as they have consented already. This is for the safety of our members, which we take very seriously.\n\nWe are happy you are here and hope you find this a supportive community. All of the rules are above are to ensure that you are safe and that the people you will be interacting with are validating, here for the 'right reasons', and are properly vetted. We look forward to meeting you!\nx\nKay R., Roby, Nataliya, Christine, Debby, Kay O. & Saleh",

We\u2019re the Hash House Harriers, a social club based on our mutual love of beer, running, and good fun! Cities all over the world have Hash House running clubs called \u201ckennels\u201d and you\u2019ve just found Boston\u2019s!\n\nStarting from a different area of the city (usually in a bar) every Wednesday at 6:30 pm in the summer and every Sunday at 2:30 pm in the winter, we set out on a trail marked in chalk by one or two of our members.\n\n**Do we know where we\u2019re going?**\n\nNO!!! (And that\u2019s all part of the fun)\n\nTrails in Boston always start and end near an MBTA subway station of some kind.\nNormal trails are 3 to 5 miles in length (walkers options are available!)\n\n**What does it cost?**\n\n$5 covers beers, water, and snacks throughout, and especially at the end of all trails.\n\n**Why would I ever do that?**\n\n* Do you love drinking but are bored of bars?\n* Do you love running but are tired of doing it sober?\n* Do you want to make new friends and explore the city in the weirdest way possible?\n* Do you want to have friends and a community in most major cities in the world?\n* Do you want an excuse to sing lewd songs with your friends?\n* Do you want to do all this (plus snacks!) for only $5 per trail?\n\nIf any of those sound appealing, cum check us out!\n\n**What if I don\u2019t drink beer?**\n\nWhile drinking is central to our culture, we do have members who don\u2019t drink and we will never pressure you to drink. (We also provide gluten free options for those who need them.)\n\n**Wait, what about lewd humor and silly songs?**\n\nYeah, **we're a 21+ group,** and we sing some raunchy songs at some of the stops and during the ending circle (which is when we gather at the end of trail to enjoy some beers, celebrate, and make announcements). Those who hash for long enough end up with similarly humorous nicknames, too. It\u2019s always in the spirit of good fun and friendly humor.\n\n**Will I fit in?**\n\nAbsolutely! We're friendly to all, we promise. Feel free to send us a message and someone in our mismanagement crew will answer any questions you may have, text you details about the next few trails, and make sure someone knows your name before you show up. Or just show up! We're looking forward to meeting you!",

That's our term for people of African heritage (i.e., African, African-American, Afro-Caribbean, Afro-Latinx, Afro-European) who love to spread their wings and travel to unusual, unexpected and interesting places. The Onyxbird also thrives on cultural exploration and tends to be socially conscious. Unfortunately, Onyxbirds tend to fly solo or as a pair. Very rarely are \"flocks\" of Onyxbirds spotted in China or Argentina or Finland or New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this group is to develop and maintain a Boston flock of Onyxbirds. We&nbsp;share travel tales, photos, food, music, recommendations, horror stories and more from our travels. We even schedule some \"migrations\"!!</p>\n<p>Please note that this group is not meant to be exclusionary. It is simply meant as a way to encourage people from the African diaspora to travel together and experience destinations other than the usual ones (e.g., Caribbean islands, Cancun, USA, etc.). We will always welcome birds from other flocks into the nest with open wings.</p>\n<p><b>How Our Trips Work</b></p>\n<p><b><i>Each traveler is individually responsible for scheduling and funding their own flights/lodging.</i></b></p>\n<p>Trip ideas are posted on our calendar by either the Organizer or one of the Assistant Organizers.&nbsp; Once a trip is posted, a series of planning meetings are usually scheduled. These meetings serve as an opportunity for travelers to meet each other and collaborate on all aspects of the voyage, including booking assistance, roommate planning, excursion ideas, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you RSVP for a trip, physically attending most, if not all, of the planning meetings is strongly encouraged. However, if you are unable to attend, there is usually at least one alternative option available to remain updated about trip info (i.e. conference call, emailed notes, etc.).</p>\n<p>Our trips are designed to be group oriented, while still allowing travelers to pursue their own individual interests in the destination.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Come get blown away by travel with the ONYXBIRDS!<br></p>\n<p><a class=\"embedded\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-RABR4FCAc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-RABR4FCAc</a></p>",

Our meetups will be in the form of Laughter Yoga and Meditation sessions followed by brief discussions about laughter and play in our lives. \u00a0Laughter Yoga and Meditation involves simple movements, breathing, and obviously laughter, and is open to all ages. \u00a0Comfortable clothing is a plus but Laughter Yoga and Meditation isn't your usually yoga class so no special attire, mats, or props required although you'd be quite surprised on how much a workout continuous laughter can be. \u00a0No previous experience in yoga, meditation, or having a sense of humor necessary. \u00a0Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>Kevin and I\u00a0started this group because we like to play and laugh, and laughter yoga was one of\u00a0the best ways we have found to fulfill that basic need. There are many proven physical\u00a0and psychological health benefits to the practice, which have been backed by peer-reviewed studies, but speaking to people about laughter yoga what comes up often\u00a0is that people feel they\u2019re not having enough fun in their life. We would like to\u00a0address that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which brings up the question: What is laughter yoga? Despite the name, there are\u00a0<br>\n\nno physical poses. What it takes from yoga is the attitude of practice \u2013 the idea isn\u2019t\u00a0<br>\n\nto be the best at doing the exercises, but simply to start where you are and begin\u00a0<br>\n\nto develop, over time, an innate and core aspect of your humanity. While yoga\u00a0<br>\n\nconcentrates mainly on the body, this practice focuses primarily on the capacity for\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughter and playfulness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Laughter is by its nature contagious, so while it may begin like \"fake\" laughter, it\u00a0<br>\n\noften turns into real authentic laughter. \u00a0Playful exercises are generally the types of games you would play with a young\u00a0child.</p>\n<p>Time Magazine, The Huffington Post, and The New Yorker (subscription needed for\u00a0<br>\n\nfull article) have all written about laughter yoga. Though he has no affiliation with\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughter yoga, Dr. Stuart Brown gave an interesting TED talk on the importance\u00a0<br>\n\nof play to the human brain. In addition, there is a plethora of information on\u00a0<br>\n\nlaughteryoga.org. \u00a0 Or check out a local article here about one of our leaders Jason,\u00a0http://huntnewsnu.com/2011/02/laughter-meditation-a-trend-in-relaxation/</p>\n<p>This group will be led by two experienced leaders \u2013 Deborah Bennett who is a\u00a0<br>\n\ncertified Laughter Yoga instructor and currently teaches it to veterans, and Jason\u00a0<br>\n\nJedrusiak, a certified yoga instructor who leads a weekly laughter groups at Northeastern University and throughout Boston.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n</p>",

        "description": "Who We Are\n\nFounded in 1971, the Shambhala Meditation Center of Boston is home to a community who share a genuine connection to contemplative practice and the aspiration to realize a more wakeful, sane society. Among us are dedicated senior teachers who have walked the Shambhala Buddhist path for many years, and enthusiastic newcomers who are just discovering the teachings on realizing basic goodness. Friends and members of the Shambhala Center are welcome to attend celebrations, practice events, meetings and gatherings of various groups.\n\nOur Mission Statement\n\nThe Boston Shambhala Center provides space and support for following a path of meditation. Our mission is to cultivate the worthiness, wisdom and compassion of individuals and society based on the inherent goodness of humanity and the natural world. Our core path is an experiential, progressive path of meditation and study, supported by a community of other practitioners, and extending to the ordinary activities of daily life. The roots of our practices are the Shambhala lineage, the Buddhist lineages of Kagy\u00fc and Nyingma, and the earth-based B\u00f6n tradition of Central Asia.\nWe train in meditation to better know our minds and hearts and to cultivate the qualities of openness, bravery and kindness. We view the coming together of people, in any form and at any scale, as a situation with intrinsic sacredness. We aspire to create an environment where all people are welcome and respected, with support to participate as fully as they choose. Respecting that each individual\u2019s journey is their own, we welcome all who are interested in personal, spiritual and societal awakening.\n\nWeekly Practice Events\n\nOur center has a rich array of ongoing offerings open to the public including weekly public sitting meditation hours and dharma talks. No prior meditation experience required to attend. All are welcome. Weekly Events Information\nGetting Involved\nOur community and center is almost entirely volunteer run. All of our programs are staffed by volunteers, as well as our councils and committees. People from all walks of life dedicate some amount of time to support other people to sit on the cushion and become familiar with their own basic goodness. The vision of a sane and awake society begins with one simple act: Getting Involved.\n\nFamily and Children\n\nWe welcome families at the Boston Shambhala Center as a vital part of our community. Our aspiration is to have a local Shambhala community in which families gather for practice; feel included and supported. Contact us about bringing your family to the center at: info@shambhalaboston.org\n\nSeasonal Celebrations\n\nOver the years our community has adopted a tradition of celebrating the changes of the seasons. These are called \u201cnyida\u201d days from the Tibetan words nyima (sun) and dawa (moon), and they occur on or near the days of the equinoxes and solstices. Nyida days are family-oriented celebrations and occasions for local Shambhala communities to gather socially. Midsummer Day observes the summer solstice; the Harvest of Peace the autumn equinox; Children\u2019s Day, the winter solstice. Shambhala Day is our annual celebration of \u201closar\u201d or the new year according to the Tibetan calendar. Since it typically falls in February or March, it takes the place of observing the spring equinox.",

        "description": "<p>Join us for weekly practice in Boston just a couple of blocks from the Tuffs Medical Center Orange Line T station on Washington Street. Our practice is 90 minutes of traditional Japanese karate with direct lineage to Gichin Funakoshi and includes kihon, kumite and kata. Practitioners of all levels are welcome. You will receive the highest caliber instruction. Come experience Boston\u2019s best kept secret!</p>\n<p>Practice is on Mondays and Thursdays from 7:15 \u2013 9.00 P.M. and Saturdays from 10:15 A.M. to Noon.</p>\n<p>Karate-do is the Way of the Empty Hand. It is derived from the ancient Okinawan fighting style and heavily influenced by the Chinese martial arts. The style of karate we practice is the traditional Shotokan as practiced from the time of Gichin Funakoshi. We are affiliated with Shotokan Karate of America (SKA).</p>\n<p>Master Gichin Funakoshi introduced karate-do to mainland Japan in 1916. He had been initiated into all the major Okinawan karate methods and taught a synthesis of the Okinawan styles as a total discipline. This method became known as Shotokan. Because of the great popularity of the style in Japan and, later, around the world, Funakoshi is widely considered to be the \u201cfather of modern karate-do. Aside from creating Shotokan karate and introducing it to Japan and the world, Funakoshi Sensei also wrote several books, one of which is \u201cKarate-Do Kyohan\u201d - The Master Text, which is the \u201chandbook\u201d of Shotokan. The original Japanese text of Karate-Do Kyohan was translated into English by Tsutomu Ohshima in 1973.</p>\n<p>We practice Shotokan karate in the traditional manner for the development of mind, body, and spirit. This art form has been passed down from teachers to students in an unbroken line from Funakoshi Sensei himself to Ohshima Sensei to us. We believe it is the responsibility of each practitioner to learn and practice the techniques correctly so that the tradition is preserved and can be passed on intact to the next generation.</p>\n<p>Shotokan Karate of America is a national nonprofit organization that has been teaching traditional karate-do in the United States since 1955. SKA was founded and is still led by Tsutomu Ohshima, who is one of Master Funakoshi Sensei\u2019s last direct pupils. In 1955 Mr. Ohshima came to the United States and was the first person to teach karate to the U.S. public.

Come meet other local climbers and be a part of it!\nOur purpose is to provide social networking events and opportunities for Boston-area climbers of all levels, beginner to advanced, to meet, climb together, make more climbing partner contacts for personal adventures, and share climbing-related information. We don't generally teach novices, or offer instructional programs, but we can give advice on how and where to get the training and equipment you need. And occasionally professional guiding services will offer special training opportunities with our group. Once proficient at basic skills, we can all learn further from each other, sharing tips and ideas on advanced skills, techniques, and styles. The Boston climbing community, including this Meetup group, has cool people from many different backgrounds, and from around the globe, so you can also learn a lot about the world while sharing your passion for the vertical domain!\n*Seasoned climbers know it well, but to those who are new: Keep it fun by climbing smart and safe. Climbing is inherently dangerous, and any bad fall (rock, ice, or human) can result in serious injury or death. Proper training and good common sense are important to minimize risks. Your participation in any climbing activity (and any activity with this Meetup group) is AT YOUR OWN RISK. Ward Smith summed it up nicely: \"If you do get hurt, don't even think about blaming someone else. You made the decision to walk up to the cliff and get on a particular route . . . instead of staying home, watching football, and eating cheese doodles like the rest of the 'free' world. Have fun, but climb safely, and take responsibility for your own actions.\"*",

        "description": "**Join Gambeta Football Club \u2013 Where Passion for Soccer Meets Community Spirit!**\n\nAt Gambeta Football Club, we bring together the best recreational soccer games for men and women in the greater Boston area. Our members are not just teammates but also competitors and friends, united by a love for the beautiful game. As a club created by players, for players, we pride ourselves on fostering an inclusive and dynamic environment.\n\nWhen you join our pickup games, we have a few guidelines to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone:\n\n1. **No slide tackling**, even if it seems clean.\n2. **Self-regulate fouls**: If someone claims a foul, respect their call, hand over the ball, and keep the game flowing.\n3. **Ball retrieval**: If you kick the ball out of bounds, please retrieve it promptly.\n4. **Minimize disputes**: Avoid wasting time on arguments about calls; focus on keeping the game moving.\n5. **Positive vibes only**: Encourage and uplift your fellow players. No criticism, just good energy.\n\nThese rules have helped us maintain a fun and secure atmosphere since our founding eight years ago. Adherence to these principles is crucial, and players who do not comply will be asked to leave the group.\n![](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/1/0/7/600_460584839.jpeg)\nAdditionally, if you RSVP \"yes\" to an event and fail to show up without timely notice, you will be removed from the group. This includes last-minute changes to your RSVP.\nWe aim to host as many free and open games as possible. Occasionally, we may charge a fee to cover costs for facilities or field rentals, especially for our indoor games.\n\nLocated in Boston, we play every single week, year-round, at top-notch venues with professional equipment. Our high-quality games feature a diverse group of talented players, each bringing an average of over 20 years of soccer experience. Our members hail from all over the world, including the USA, Brazil, France, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, Albania, England, Germany, Ireland, Argentina, Italy, and Greece. Together, we spread the \"Cultura de Futbol!\"\n\nJoin us at Gambeta Football Club and be part of a vibrant soccer community where the love for the game and camaraderie go hand in hand.",

Women bonded together by challenging themselves in the outdoors. Women who naturally encouraged one another and connected right away. Women who live to LIVE. \u2060\u00a0\n\u2060\u00a0\n\ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The friendships are REAL. \u2060\u00a0\n\ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The vulnerability on the trails is REAL. \u2060\u00a0\n\ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The empowerment is REAL. \u2060\u00a0\n\ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The personal growth is REAL. \u2060\u00a0\n\ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The cuss words, inside jokes, and SHE-naningans are REAL. \u2060\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd we\u2019ve been doing it since 2014! That year, Explorer Chick founder, Nicki Bruckmann was a wife, cat mom and home owner who worked full-time in corporate finance. Instead of feeling fulfilled by ticking all the boxes, she found herself feeling stifled. She made the choice to break away from it all and step out of that life. To figure things out, she needed a vacation reset. But not just any vacation. She wanted something that would feed her adventurous soul and push boundaries. But the thing about divorce? You lose that built-in travel buddy. Believing that other women must also be in the same situation; craving adventure and travel and not wanting to do it all alone, she launched Explorer Chick!

Launching in 2015, Explorer Chick ran one trip with three bold ladies looking for adventure. From there, this amazing community of women continues to grow, and in 2022 more than 1100 women traveled with us on 133 trips over 5 continents!\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhether you arrive as a solo traveler or with several of your closest gal pals, you\u2019ll be greeted by a group of like-minded women travelers of all ages who love to go hiking, camping, rafting, backpacking, canyoning, surfing, kayaking, climbing and more.

We are a group of people who meet every Tuesday to connect with each other, and practice drawing the human form from a live, nude model in a supportive, social environment. Whether you're a seasoned artist or just looking to try something new - you're welcome here! \n\nThe night begins with some time dedicated to meeting and getting to know others in the space. Timed poses begin at 6:45, spanning from short, 30-second gesture drawings to 30-minute long poses (and most things in between). \n\nThere is little formal instruction, but ample space for questions, feedback, and pointers. There are two breaks throughout the night for more socializing and getting feedback on your work. \n\nSupplies and food will be provided. Music will be played. Good times will be had by all.",

We also try to promote other relevant secular and humanistic events from other chapters and groups in this geographical area.\u00a0Ask to be on our email list for free newletter or check this site and FB frequently.\n\nWe are a membership organization and a chapter of the American Humanist Association.

We seek to leverage the revolutionary spirit of New England to help open, improve, and engage our local governments across the Greater Boston area and to pursue projects that solve real problems in our communities.\nIn conjunction with our fellow brigades across the country, we aim to provide a focal point for community-based civic innovation and technology projects in the Boston area.

In spiritual terms this is known as an awakening. Put simply, there is a subtle yet permanent shift in one's understanding of self identity: There is an identification with a boundless presence existing beyond just the subject of experience. This experience can be confusing, jarring, or even (hopefully) liberating for an individual.\n\nThis purpose of this group is to be a forum to discuss nonduality (teachers, practices, philosophy, experiences).\n\nHoping to meet once a month in person. Stay tuned.",

For those of you who are new, this email is to give some basic information about how you can get more involved with us and get on even more trips (our other websites have more trip postings than you\u2019ll find here on Meetup!)\n[AMC Boston 20's and 30's](https://ym.amcboston.org/) is a group of the [Appalachian Mountain Club](https://www.outdoors.org/) (AMC), dedicated to encouraging people in their 20s and 30s to get involved in the AMC and enjoy the outdoors.\u00a0\nWith many volunteer leaders and co-leaders, we offer a variety of activities and events (both online and in-person). You may find us leading day hikes, backpacking, social events, local walks, trail maintenance, conservation work, kayaking, mountain biking, bicycling, skiing, camping, ice skating, and other activities. We sponsor trips throughout the year, most of which involve exploring different regions of New England. Check out some [photos](https://www.meetup.com/AMC-Boston-Young-Members/photos/31347892/) of our activities here!\nIf you want to be kept up to date with even more of our events, be sure to check the official postings at [activities.outdoors.org](http://activities.outdoors.org/search/?aud=15&grp=2).

        "description": "<p>This wonderful group was founded by Leanne who got this&nbsp;brilliant idea from a friend of a friend, Janey, of The Oxford Drunken Knitwits (UK). We're hoping to make the Drunken Knitwits group expand and become international. She has since moved on to taking over the world with her startup and some robots on her side, for now anyways. <span>Our regularly scheduled knitnites is every Monday at 7pm. Also find us on meetup!</span> Also find us on facebook,&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/groups/BostonDrunkenKnitwits/</p><p><br /></p><p>Most of our members will agree that the Drunken Knitwits are hands-down the best knitting clubs in existence today, and probably ever. The first chapter was established in Oxford, UK in 2012 to fill a desperate need for old-fashioned drunken knitting get-togethers. Break-out chapters have been popping up ever since and now we're in 3 continents, 4 countries, and 8 cities. There's no looking back! Whether you're a knitter who needs to add a social aspect to your hobby, someone who's always wanted to learn to knit, or someone who's new to town and wants to take on a new hobby while making friends, then the Drunken Knitwits are the people you\u2019ve been looking for.</p><p>3 TENETS OF DRUNKEN KNITHOOD</p><p>1. If you're embarrassed to knit in a pub, then you're taking yourself way too seriously, and could use a lesson from a Knitwit. 'Nuff said&nbsp;GET OVER YOURSELF</p><p>2. We aim to provide a friendly and welcoming environment to anyone who wishes to join. If you're a true Knitwit, you'll do the same and aim to meet at least one new person at each event you attend. DO UNTO OTHERS</p><p>3. We pride ourselves in being an active and committed group, where we can find familiar faces week after week. So come along, and stay for a while -- most Knitwits do.</p><p>Warnings and Disclaimers:</p><p>1. You may have to unpick some knitting mistakes after attending a DK event; we suggest bringing simple projects to avoid this hassle.</p><p>2. We use the term \"knit\" roughly; if you prefer crochet, that's cool.</p><p>3. Drinking is optional; crafting is not.</p>",

        "description": "Welcome to the ground floor of this new endeavor. My name is Cesar and after the pandemic I realized that I wanted more connection in my life. I took the first step and moved to Boston. I have made some incredible connections so far and I want to create a space that gives me and anyone willing to try to\n\nMeet new people\nPlay outside your normal box.\nPractice self-expression.\nExplore Boston and it surroundings\nConnect with others.\nGet new stories and experiences.\n\nOn this meetup my goal is to host events to go to new restaurants, night markets, escape rooms, movie nights, board games, museums, walks through the park. As a newbie in the city I'm always open for suggestions. I'm also looking for motivated people that want to organize events and help me grow this community. I hope to meet you soon.\n\n**A FEW RULES TO KEEP US ORGANIZED AND SAFE:**\n**PICTURE POLICY:**\nWe require that you have a photo (for security reasons) that is a current picture of yourself on your Meetup profile that **clearly shows your face** (**without sunglasses**),\u00a0first name (please no one letter or number names). Anyone without a photo and name will not be allowed to attend events.\n**RSVP POLICY:**\nPLEASE RSVP with integrity as space is limited & it's not fair to others or the venue to do a last minute cancellation. Last minute cancellations (meaning after the event closes - time which can be seen on the app if set for the event) count as **NO SHOWS & it's 3 strikes you're out of the group**. Emergencies/illness happen--we get it--and it only takes a few seconds to change your RSVP from ATTENDING to NOT ATTENDING.\u00a0This is also YOUR responsibility. And it's common\u00a0courtesy.\u00a0\n**WAITLISTS:**\nYou are responsible for managing your own RSVP when on a WAITLIST. IF you stay on a WAITLIST, you could move to the going list at any time. If you assume you will not get on the going list and make other plans, it is **YOUR** responsibility to update your RSVP to not going to avoid a no show or last minute cancellation.\u00a0You have potentially taken a spot away from another member who would have loved to join the event.\n**CODE OF CONDUCT:**\nFirst and foremost we will treat each other with respect and how we would wish others to treat us. Rude/offensive/abusive/overly aggressive/highly negative/toxic behaviors and attitudes toward others **WILL NOT BE TOLERATED!** Any member may be removed from the group at the discretion of the organizer.\n**DISCLAIMER:**\n--Hosts/organizers of this group are all unpaid volunteers. All participants who join Random Acts of Connection agree to assume 100% responsibility for their own portion of the bill, safety, conduct, and well-being & solely agree to participate upon their own accord when signing up for events. The organizers of Random Acts of Connection cannot be held responsible or liable in any way for the actions of any participant - including you - at any event. When you RSVP 'Yes', to any Random Acts of Connection event, it shall be conclusively presumed that you understand & agree to this policy.\nThank you for your cooperation!",

Life is too short and the world is too big!\n\nThe trips in this group are usually 90% solo travelers but everyone is welcome, female/male, solo/couple/friends, straight/LGBTQIA+! So let\u2019s travel together with fun, like-minded travelers! If you have an open mind and are kind to fellow travelers, you will fit in perfectly on these trips!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to host a Meetup in your area (i.e. a brunch, happy hour, coffee, etc), feel free to let me know and I'll help you get it set up in the group!\n\n**NOTE:** The people on these trips are from all over the States but you\u2019ll always be connected with people from the same city on a trip so you can meet up face to face and get to know your future travel buddies prior to the trip. You\u2019ll also be connected to the whole group via email prior to the trip so you can virtually get to know those that are from different areas. On average, the people on each trip are 90% solo travelers but it\u2019s hard to predict the exact demographic for each trip so please keep this in mind.\n\nFeel free to join the Facebook group to connect with past travelers on these trips, see pictures, ask questions, funny travel memes, travel-related articles, etc.: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/613025845523107](https://www.facebook.com/groups/613025845523107)\n\nThe trips in this group are put on by a tour company called Globe Drifters and they focus on small group trips geared towards solo travelers with the mission of giving new meaning to travel by putting the human experience at the heart of their trips. The groups are small, usually with 12 people maximum per trip and about 90% of everyone on each trip are solo travelers so you\u2019re not stuck being the odd man out on trips with mostly couples. You\u2019ll have the best of both worlds, solo travel with the security of a small group of other solo travelers for some company on your adventure!

        "description": "Let's Party!!!\n\nWelcome to Party Boston, There are so many great things about this city, first and foremost; YOU we do not cater to any one crowd because we believe in unity through diversity. Being unique is what brings us together and keeps us friends. We meet up for activities like dinner, movies, dancing, and exploring Boston.\n\nPlease make sure your photo is of YOU and not a pet/landscape/cartoon, as it'll be easier for us to spot you at events\n\nWe also believe that a strong community comes from within. If you'd like to see a particular event, offer to host one. If you like hosting events and have fun doing it, ask about becoming an Event Organizer. It's very rewarding to lead events and giving value to your fellow group members is wicked good karma. ;)\n\nRSVP Expectations\nA lot goes into planning events and everyone who shows up to an event is counting on everyone else who RSVP's to show up as well. Therefore, you are advised to keep your RSVP's up to date. Sometimes things pop up and you can't make it, it's inevitable. Please do your best to update your RSVP. It's a very good habit to get into.\n\ncheck out some of my other groups..

If you\u2019ve got a project you want to hack on, or a problem you\u2019d like help with, bring it along. If not, just bring yourself! Developers of all experience levels are welcome.</p>\n<p><b>Who should join:</b>&nbsp;Swift and Objective-C developers of all experience levels are welcome! Even if you've never opened Xcode, we\u2019d love to help get you up to speed! You may also want to check out our sibling group specifically for Swift first-timers, <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Learn-Swift-Boston/\">Learn Swift Boston</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Why you should join:</b> No matter what your experience level, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a better opportunity to ask other devs the questions that are keeping you up at night. It\u2019s also a great opportunity to solidify your knowledge by teaching. Plus, there will be plenty of great conversation with a group of intelligent like-minded people.</p>\n<p><b>What can you expect?</b> This meetup is super laid back. After a brief introduction, we\u2019ll naturally fall into smaller working groups. People might be working individually, or in small groups, but there will always be interesting conversations about areas of Swift development that you might not be aware of.</p>\n<p><span>We expect anyone attending our events to abide by our&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/SwiftCodersBoston/pages/25752236/Code_of_Conduct/\">Code of Conduct</a><span>.&nbsp;</span><br></p>",

This group going forward will focus on volunteering, but I need your help to find opportunities for us to help out around Boston! Please feel free to reach out me with any questions or suggestions for future volunteering events.\n\n**Below is the original Description, I will update this more thoroughly at a later date but for now keeping it:**\nSWIMMING AGAINST THE STREAM: THE BOSTON VOLUNTEERS\n\u00a0\nThey said it was impossible. They said it couldn't be done. Create a way to organize and empowers thousands of caring people to help fellow Bostonians in need? And do it in a no-hassle, no commitment way where folks can easily choose where and how they want to help?\n\u00a0\nWhen we started the Boston Volunteers, we bucked all the trends. No mandatory training sessions for new people. No large corporate structures or high costs. Simply a bunch of good-natured and hard working people wanting to make our little corner of the world a better place. Why?\nBecause we believe in better.\n\u00a0\nWith nothing more than word-of-mouth reputation, Meetup.com as a springboard, and a knack for gathering some of the coolest people around, the Boston Volunteers have experienced exponential and geometric growth. Who would have imagined that in three years we'd have more than forty seven hundred good-hearted Boston Volunteers standing up and fighting for better? Not us, for sure!\n\nWhile we are so incredibly grateful for all the volunteers who are already part of our community, there are still countless people in our neighborhood who find themselves in need. That's why we need you. All you need is a caring heart and a willingness to share a little bit of your valuable time.\n\u00a0\nJoin us and spend an evening in a Boston soup kitchen; help tutor a single, local mom so she can earn her GED; rebuild your neighborhood playground so kids can play safely; kayak and clean the Charles to better our environment; build a home for a local family; spend time with the elderly. The variety is endless and refreshing. You choose where and when. There will be a convenient volunteer celebration for you. Don't miss this easy opportunity to build community.\n\u00a0\nWhile the Boston Volunteers have a well-earned reputation for having hard working and dependable folks, we're also known to have a pretty good time doing so. Beyond having fun while helping others, we also celebrate a variety of social events in your neighborhood where we simply spend a little time relaxing and getting to know each other.\n\u00a0\nVolunteer enough and you will make some meaningful and lasting friendships with some truly great people. I've build a growing and meaningful community. We often see each other at community volunteer events and frequently go to museums together. Please know that since day one, we have been an open and inclusive nonprofit community, where every volunteer- regardless of superficial differences is valued, respected and needed. Not only can you choose where and when you would like to volunteer, but also you are encouraged to bring new ideas and new volunteer opportunities to our attention. And if you have a passion and there's a need, we'll get you set up to lead your own volunteer event. We revere the can-do spirit.\n\nCan you think of how we can better help people? Please share.\nWe are determinedly pursuing perfection.\n\u00a0\nAre you ready to partner with a community our like-minded folks as we help our neighbors in need? Set-out to make our city a better place for us all?\nLearn more about our popular nonprofit, take a peek at upcoming celebrations, sign up when there's a space, and start making a difference! If you ever have questions, feel free to email any of the assistant organizers. We are here for you.\n\nWelcome to THE BOSTON VOLUNTEER FAMILY! We anticipate volunteering with you!\nJosh\nEntrepreneur of The Boston Volunteers\nLearn more about the Boston Volunteers: www.BostonVolunteer.org\n\nP.S.

Stay tuned both at the Boston Azure event site (where you are now) and at the [North Boston Azure](https://www.meetup.com/north-boston-azure-cloud-user-group/) event site. We plan to continue Virtual Boston Azure events in parallel to in-person events.*\n\nBoston Azure is a community-run group with the goal of learning about cloud computing with the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform. We have been meeting since October 2009, making us the oldest such Azure-focused community group in the world. The group was founded by Bill Wilder ([@codingoutloud](https://twitter.com/codingoutloud)).\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback you can reach out to @bostonazure on twitter - or to any of us directly via twitter (handles below) via Meetup messaging.\n\n*Sincerely,*\n\n* Veronika - [@veronika_dev1](https://twitter.com/veronika_dev1)\n* Jason - [@haleyjason](https://twitter.com/haleyjason)\n* Bill - [@codingoutloud](https://twitter.com/codingoutloud)\n\nThe group is run by volunteers. So far for all the events we've hosted over the years, we've managed to provide them for free to attendees. This is in large part to Microsoft offering free space at NERD where we've held the vast majority of our events, to MIT for help with some of our bootcamp events, but also to the occasional meeting/event sponsor.\n\nWe have introduced a [Code of Conduct](https://bostonazure.github.io/codeofconduct.html). Your [feedback](https://github.com/bostonazure/bostonazure.github.io/issues) is welcome.\n\nWe are currently hosting meeting signups on [Meetup.com/bostonazure](https://meetup.com/bostonazure), but you can also find our top-level site through the simpler URL [bostonazure.org](http://bostonazure.org/).\n\nYou can also find us on Twitter as [@bostonazure](https://twitter.com/bostonazure).\n\nAnd feel free to join our Slack community at [bit.ly/baslack](https://bit.ly/baslack).\n\nBoston Azure usually meets in the Boston/Cambridge area. You may also be interested in the North Boston Azure group, run by Jason Haley ([@haleyjason](https://twitter.com/haleyjason)), which meets in Burlington, MA.\n\nBored?

It is a branch of the original [NYC-based community](https://www.meetup.com/WomenofcultureNYC/) (with over 4K members) designed to connect, empower and inspire women through meaningful engagement with the arts.\nYou can learn more about the original NYC-based group [here](https://www.meetup.com/WomenofcultureNYC/) and see some of the 300+ events we've hosted in NYC & beyond.\n\nWe curate a wide variety of art-based events such as fine art tours, performance outings and Art-full Discovery walks, all of which are grounded in community and designed to cultivate a more meaningful connection to the arts, oneself and the world at large. \n\nEach of our experiences is thoughtfully organized with the intention of encouraging women to push their boundaries, discover new perspectives and more deeply understand themselves and the world around them \u2014\u00a0so they are better equipped to shape it.\n\n**At every Women of Culture experience,\u00a0you will:**\n\n* **Discover**\u00a0& learn more about new art forms or artists, broaden your horizons and awaken your curiosity.\u00a0\n* **Experience**\u00a0the power of art to transform, inspire and enlighten.\u00a0\n* **Connect**\u00a0with a tribe of fellow art-full women.\n\n\nThe majority of attendees and members are professional women in their late 20\u2019s-50\u2019s who are interested in getting out and experiencing all that the rich NYC & LA art scenes have to offer. No artistic talent, knowledge or experience is needed \u2014 we are all learning along the way!\n\nEvery effort is made to keep events community-oriented so that all feel welcome, whether it is their first or 50th time attending. Most women attend events alone \u2014\u00a0and leave with a new friend, or more. All that is required is an open mind & an interest in art!\n\nLearn more [here](https://www.womenofculture.org) and follow us on IG [here](https://www.instagram.com/womenofculturenyc/).",

Practice speaking, find out about cultures, styles, history, current events, and meet new friends!\nPeople who want to speak (or hear) Japanese or English can join. It is open to all ages, and all levels of skill. Generally speaking, all people are welcome to join this club, however it is expected that everyone abide by the following basic guidelines:\n\n1. Individuals must respect one another.\n2. Let's keep a positive attitude about things!\n3. Let's have a really great time!\n\nWe meet in a casual environment such as a restaurant, and people just form natural conversations or practice groups. And if you are looking for a language exchange partner, you may find one here.\u00a0But **we are not a class - please don't show up and expect one.**\u00a0If you have specific questions, you can get answers here.\n\n**We are not a dating club.**\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, there have been a number of\u00a0cases where male members have been making passes at female members, asking for dates, emailing women and asking to meet up, asking women for their phone numbers or pestering them to be added to their Facebook friends.\u00a0In the past we have had female members who stopped coming to meetups because they were made uncomfortable by some of our members' behavior.\u00a0**We will not tolerate this type of behavior**.\u00a0**You should assume that our members are there to discuss culture and ask and answer questions about language and are not looking for dates, and should not initiate any request for dates without very clear signals that these requests are welcome.\u00a0If a woman offers you to make you her Facebook friend, that is fine to accept, but be very cautious about asking for hers.\u00a0Also, do not message through Meetup looking for dates under any circumstances.**\u00a0\u00a0If you make other members uncomfortable you will either be banned immediately or given a warning depending on the seriousness.\u00a0If you get a warning and if there are any further concerns with respect to your behavior after the warning,\u00a0you will be banned at that point.\u00a0We have done this before and we will not hesitate to do so in future.\u00a0\u00a0\n**To our female members: please do not hesitate to message or call me at 617-818-2923\u00a0if anyone bothers you, emails you or otherwise pesters you or makes you uncomfortable.\u00a0This type of activity happens when no one talks about it.\u00a0I am more than happy to talk to any members about any issues, and to warn or ban them if appropriate.\u00a0But I can only do that if I either see it personally (which rarely happens) or if someone tells me about it.**\n**Dues are currently suspended.**\u00a0At some point I may start asking for people to pay $1\u00a0per meetup of $5 for the year, but at the moment I am not bothering.\u00a0Member dues are mainly used for the Meetup website cost which is $200 per year.\n\nSuzanne\nOrganizer",

New and experienced players are both welcome!</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll be playing a mix of one-shot adventures designed specifically for new players. Ask questions, learn how to play, and meet new people! Pre-made characters are provided in the event description or you can roll your own on D&amp;D Beyond. Play time is typically around 4 hours. Please arrive on time and keep your RSVP status up-to-date! More details can be found in the individual events.</p>\n<p>Some of the common questions we get:</p>\n<p><b>What if I've never played D&amp;D before and know nothing about it?</b>&nbsp;Perfect! Lots of people who show up for Newbie Sessions have never played before. You'll be in good company and we will help you along the way!</p>\n<p><b>Can I spectate a game?</b>&nbsp;Unfortunately, no. We found spectators to be disruptive because they were connecting and disconnecting or forgetting to mute their microphones. We also found that many players don\u2019t like having an audience when they play since it adds more pressure. See our FAQ for more information.</p>\n<p><b>Which races and classes can I play?</b>&nbsp;This may depend on your DM, but generally anything officially published and playtested is acceptable. See our Player Resources page on each event for more information.</p>\n<p><b>What is a one-shot? What if I missed the last event?</b>&nbsp;That's ok! One-shots are events that are completed in a single sitting. Each game is independent from the others. Just don't sign-up for the same event a second time because it's the same story.</p>\n<p><b>What if I'm not very creative or bad at roleplaying?</b>&nbsp;No problem. We've got you covered! If you're struggling with something, the DM will step in and help provide some ideas. Many new players struggle with the openness and freedom of D&amp;D. We'll be there to support you throughout the entire game.</p>\n<p>Official website:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndnewbies.com/\">https://www.dndnewbies.com/</a></p>\n<p>More FAQs:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndnewbies.com/faq/\">https://www.dndnewbies.com/faq/</a></p>\n<p>Join our Discord server:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discord.gg/RkYRrkC\">https://discord.gg/RkYRrkC</a></p>\n<p>Important links:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://linktr.ee/dndnewbies\">https://linktr.ee/dndnewbies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://linktr.ee/dndnewbies\"></a></p>",

Content will be in the form of lightning talks (10-20 minutes), with breaks to meet and chat in-between. \u00a0We aim for content to conclude between 8:15 and 8:30 PM, but will just go with the flow.\n\u2022\u00a0**Content will be driven by the community**. \u00a0We also remember that a big part of these events is to bring the community together, so lightning talks are preferred. \u00a0This will not be a place that you come after work to watch people lecture at you for three hours. Contact the organizers if you wanna do talk or have content ideas!\n\n\u2022\u00a0**RSVPs are highly encouraged (and sometimes strictly required depending on the venue)** for our events, but unless specified otherwise all practitioners, or those interested in learning about security, are encouraged to come eat, drink, meet others in the community, and share ideas... no strings attached.\n\n\u2022 If you would like to submit a talk for speaking please fill out the details at [https://forms.gle/eqFV9RQz5uefnmqY6](https://forms.gle/eqFV9RQz5uefnmqY6)\n\u2022 For any queries or general feedback/suggestions please email us at boston.secmeetup@gmail.com\n\n**Code of Conduct** \\- Adapted from DEF CON's CoC Page\\.\n\nBoston Security Meetup (BSM) provides a forum for open discussion between participants, where radical viewpoints are welcome and a high degree of skepticism is expected. However, insulting or harassing other participants is unacceptable. We want BSM to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. It\u2019s not about what you look like but what\u2019s in your mind and how you present yourself that counts at BSM.\nWe do not condone harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion and referral to the relevant authorities.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating at BSM - from attendees and exhibitors to speakers, press, volunteers, and Organizers.\nAnyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact an Organizer.\n\nRemember: The Meetup is what you make of it, and as a community we can create a great experience for everyone.\n\n(BSM is not in any way affiliated with DEF CON or any of its subsidiaries.

La gente es s\u00faper simp\u00e1tica y el grupo nos da chance de conocer a otras personas con intereses internacionales. La mayoria hablan espa\u00f1ol como primer idioma o avanzado pero siempre vienen algunos de todo nivel quienes se encuentran unos a otros. \u00a0 Hablamos completamente en espa\u00f1ol.</p>\n<p>Las reuniones son oportunidades informales para conocer y charlar con otros miembros del grupo. \u00a0Tenemos varios eventos para complacer a diferentes intereses. \u00a0Siempre estamos buscando nuevot organizadors, asi que si te animes, manda un mensaje a Kaela.</p>\n<p>Ahora conectate con nosotros en Facebook: \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/meetupdeboston\">https://www.facebook.com/meetupdeboston</a></p>\n<p>Nota sobre finanzas: Cobramos $10 por a\u00f1o o $1 por evento a cada miembro para apoyar en los gastos de nuestra pagina de meetup ($144/a\u00f1o) y de las etiquetas. De vez en cuando tambien negocios nos apatrocinan pagando los gastos de la pagina por un periodo de 6 meses, por ejemplo ahora con MasSpanish (es posible en el futuro que existen otras formas de patrocinio, pero por ahora esto es). Cuando tenemos patrocinio y tambien mucha gente asistiendo los eventos de Cambridge, recibo mas de lo que necesito para cubrir gastos. He decidido que cuando esto pasa, donare el dinero extra a Common Hope (www.commonhope.org), una ONG fantastico en Guatemala. Espero que les parezca este arreglo. Para mi resulta un \"win-win\" - es poca la contribucion de cada uno, pero siempre tengo lo necesario para cubrir gastos, y tambien hay otros beneficiarios en Guatemala.</p>\n<p>\u00a1Bienvenidos!</p>",

These events are free to attend, with donations gratefully accepted. As a very new group, we extend a warm welcome to all new members eager to explore mindfulness and meditation together.\n\nWhen enough members join, a meetup event with a time and location will be posted. Here's what you can expect from our first meditation gathering: \n*We'll start by mingling and getting to know one another, followed by finding a serene space to meditate together. \n*Our meditation session will be brief, approximately 20 minutes in duration. \n*If the mood strikes, we can opt for a social activity afterward, like grabbing a bite to eat or enjoying a cozy caf\u00e9. \n\nAs a very new group, there will be a very a laid-back and flexible approach to our events. Looking forward to the opportunity to connect with you soon!",

Have you looked for ways to serve, but lost hope since you couldn\u2019t make time between work, family, or friends? If you are looking for a way to help your neighbors, then this is the group for you. Boston\u2019s Good Neighbors want to create space for you to act on your desire for selfless service.\n\nThe Good Neighbors meetup is an opportunity to support your neighbors, whether they live next door or not, and build relationships centered around selfless giving. As a self-funded (AKA low budget), grassroots community group, Boston\u2019s Good Neighbors is designed to be malleable and self-adjusting based on our capacity and, most importantly, our members. BGN takes care of coordination with community partners, quick and flexible scheduling, and program development so each member can actualize their want to serve. Our most important component is, of course, you - our members; our members give BGN credence to our organizational ethos and the actual work needed to serve those who need it most in our state. Reach out to learn more and hear about what we can do for you!\n\nHow it Works:\n\n* Submit your information to become a member of Boston\u2019s Good Neighbors! There are a few questions we need you to answer so we can best utilize your time.\n* Once you are a member, you\u2019ll see volunteer postings throughout the Greater Boston area. You can join any of these opportunities or reach out to us to see if there is anything closer to you.\n* Volunteer spots will be posted throughout the week; feel free to reach out with any questions, comments, or concerns about an opportunity.\n* Subscribe to extra opportunities like food/winter clothes collection; the pickup of materials will be coordinated by BGN.\n* If you don't see a Meet and Greet coming soon, sign up for a call with Max via goodneighborsne@gmail.com and feel free to ask any questions!\n\nBoston\u2019s Good Neighbors aim to create easy-to-reach volunteer opportunities in the Greater Boston area and a strong community of members connected by their collective service to others. We hope to create a community to support our local institutions that work so hard to deliver necessities, like warm clothes and food, to those who have fallen, or have always been, on hard times. We want to lift up and build a community within our members, too, outside and inside the volunteer location!",

In practicing together, we create a foundation on which deeper emotional integration, personal growth and trauma-aware relating can emerge. As we build our capacity with these skills, we can bring it to our daily lives and host the conversations that are most important to us.",

        "description": "This will be primarily a walking meetup. We can do city walks, beach walks, trail walks and everything in between. The main goal is to get out and get walking. If you have an interest in running some events, let me know.\n\nI do not like to remove members. I have already had an issue with a few members who have RSVPed and done multiple no shows.\n\nIf you sign up for an event and then change your mind, please update the RSVP status to reflect that. Several members have done that. Thank you!\n\nIt isn't fair to other members to consistently do no shows. Someone who may really want to attend may not be able to if the event is full. Then we also wait to start events based on the sign up list. We may be waiting needlessly.\n\nThe RSVPs are going to be capped off at about 20 for most walks. This is because the parking at certain locations can be tight. The other reason-we may get a bite to eat afterwards. Finding a place to accomodate a larger group could be a problem.\n\nI understand that things happen sometimes. You can forget about an event occasionally or forget to change RSVP status or something happens at the last minute. If a member consistently does a no show, they may be removed from the group. Each time you are signed up as a yes (and do not show up at the event), it is a no show. After about 3 no shows, you may be removed depending on the situation.",

We are the most inclusive group in Boston for hiking, skiing, biking, snowboarding, and other outdoor adventures.\u00a0\n\nOur group is about the democratization of the outdoors, [so you can be the adventure spark ](https://www.ridj-it.com/adventurespark)without having to go through layers of the usual Meetup hierarchy.\u00a0\n\nDo you want to get out and go skiing but don\u2019t have a ride? We\u2019ve got your back. Have you been dreaming about surfing but can\u2019t make it out to California? We know a secret spot to paddle out, and its way closer than you think. Ridj-it has helped bring thousands of people from the creature comforts of Boston out to adventures of a lifetime all around New England.\u00a0\n\nRidj-it has taken thousands of cars off the road, and through connecting those without cars with those who have one, we've helped adventurers host over 1000+ events in just a year. Is there a mountain you've always wanted to hike?\u00a0\n\nDrivers and riders can post adventures on Ridj-it at www.ridj-it.com, and then that trip is posted to our Meetup group. Our events include people from Meetup, Facebook, and others, so we're more than your typical Boston Meetup group.\u00a0\n\n[Why do we carpool?\u00a0](https://www.ridj-it.com/single-post/2018/02/18/Why-Carpool)We found most other outdoor Meetups were leaving younger residents, people of color, and immigrants behind. By linking our trips to carpool, we make sure everyone has to work together as a team in order to go on events. Many of our hosts don't have cars, and we're proud to have a space where outdoor enthusiasts can slowly democratize access to New England's beautiful mountains, rivers, and beaches.\u00a0\n\nCheck us out on[ Facebook](http://facebook.com/ridjit)\u00a0and\u00a0[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ridj_it/), and if\u00a0you want to know more about Ridj-it, click [here](https://www.ridj-it.com/howItWorks.html).\u00a0",

        "description": "On August 22, 2024 the Christian Science Monitor, an acclaimed international newspaper, published an article about CircleSinging Boston. Here it is:\n[https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Music/2024/0822/boston-bobby-mcferrin-circlesinging-acceptance](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Music/2024/0822/boston-bobby-mcferrin-circlesinging-acceptance)\n\nBeyond MeetUp, we can be reached at \ncirclesingingboston@gmail.com\n\nOur gatherings happen in Cambridge, Arlington, Jamaica Plain, and Somerville.\n\nCircleSinging is a spontaneous, improvisational community-singing experience. In a circlesong, a leader starts by improvising a line of music and gives it / teaches it to one part of the circle. The leader then develops a second part that goes with the first and gives that part to another section of the circle. CircleSingers learn and repeat the exact part given to them. Soon we are singing a four part (at least) chorus that has never been sung before. This chorus can support individual solos.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe effect: never-before-sung, wordless, fun songs, melodies, harmonies, and rhythms. The music may be glorious or goofy, complex or simple. Each circle is a unique experience, created by a spontaneously collaborating community.\u00a0\u00a0\nA leader improvises. \u00a0CircleSingers learn and follow their parts. \u00a0**Voila!** \u2014 a newly created choral piece.\u00a0 It's easy to participate, you just repeat your part with other singers.\u00a0 Anyone can volunteer to lead, but there is never any pressure, no one is put on the spot. Our sessions include other vocal games and improv formats.\n\nThis is a \u201cmistake-free\u201d zone, for all levels of singers \u2014 we sing for the sheer fun of it! Sing beautiful harmonies without sheet music. Witness a circle of people creating music together. Come sing with us! Participants find it a joyful, exhilarating (and many have said spiritual) experience. Improvising and music-making can give insight into other life issues. Many notice cooperation, teamwork, and community.\n\nWe take inspiration from methods developed by the unique and illustrious Bobby McFerrin and his collaborators, and from CircleSinging groups in cities around the US and the world.\n\nBelow find:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0A.

A description of CircleSinging by 3 of Bobby's closest collaborators:\nThis description of CircleSongs was written by a trio of improvisors, WeBe3, Rhiannon, Joey Blake and David Worm, fabulous individuals, musicians and improvisers, and also colleagues of Bobby McFerrin & faculty with him of the annual CircleSongs workshop each August.\n\"This bold experiment in music making is a participatory ritual, allowing a sharing of culture through the medium of music, the voice in all its forms and colors. Singers gather in a circle with a conductor in the center. Intention is declared.\nFour improvised patterned parts are given to the Soprano/Alto/Tenor/Bass sections. These patterns are changed and shifted by the conductor so that the singing continues for long stretches, creating a rich, deep and joyful experience.\nThis form calls forth a wonderfully primal connectedness among the singers, strengthening relationships and developing leadership. Singers are invited to solo over this hearty vocal orchestra which requires both courage and musical focus.\nWorking this way stretches both individual and ensemble capability.\nBecause we sing in an invented language in this form, it is accessible across borders and cultures, making it possible to create this musical magic anywhere on the planet.\"",

        "description": "This group is for people wishing to learn Spanish to a high level of competency, especially if they have had trouble progressing in the past and are looking for a new way to improve.\n\nThe group workshops are hosted by Francis Collier and are free and open to anyone interested.\n\nMore information on paid lessons is available at the end of the workshop for anyone looking to improve further.\n\nThe 3 Step Process:\n\nStep 1: The 12 Sounds.\n\nIn Spanish there are 12 new sounds that do not exist in English.\nThe first step in the process to fluency is to learn ALL of these sounds CORRECTLY.\nIf you don't know what all of these sounds are please be advised Francis Collier will take everyone through them in the workshop.\n\nStep 2: Native Phrases + GVC (Grammar, Vocabulary & Comprehension).\n\nVery often Spanish learners when presented with a native level conversation find it sounds \"too fast\" and they can't keep up.\n\nCommonly there are two things that are going wrong in this step.\n\nReason 1. The 12 new sounds in Spanish have not been learnt and therefore the fundamental building blocks required are not there.\n\nReason 2. The student cannot recognise the Native Phrases used as they do not know them and have not practised recognising them. This can often happen because the student is still translating in their head from English.\n\nWhat are Native Phrases?\n\nThey are combinations of words that are used so commonly in a language that they are squeezed together and said very quickly.\n\nThink of the way someone might say \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d to their friend if they are in a drive through. It\u2019s more like \u201cwadayawan?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s exactly the same in Spanish, there are many native phrases that native speakers say every day and practising to recognise these at speed is crucial in order to understand real conversation.\n\nNote: GVC (Grammar, vocabulary and listening comprehension) are also focused on in this step.\n\nStep 3: Real Conversations at Native Speed.\n\nThe third step is to practise in a conversation at REAL Native Speed.\n\nImagine learning to play baseball by spending hours reading books on baseball, watching and analysing old games but never playing a real game at real speed.\n\nHow long do you think it would take to get good?\n\nThis being a bad idea seems very obvious in the example above but this is what so many students do with apps and books and movies when learning a language and many of them never reach fluency with this approach.\n\nSo if you are interested in coming along and learning more about the process to Spanish fluency and how to improve your Spanish then please sign up for one of our workshops.\n\nTo sign up for the workshop go to the event page and click the on \"Attend\" button for the workshop link.\n\nGood luck and we hope to see you soon.\n\nAs per meetup.com policy: Attendees under the age of 18 must have a guardian with them.",

Life is too short and the world is too big!\n\nThe trips in this group are usually 90% (or more) solo female travelers but everyone is welcome, female/male, solo/couple/friends, straight/LGBTQIA+! So let\u2019s travel together with fun, like-minded travelers! If you have an open mind and are kind to fellow travelers, you will fit in perfectly on these trips!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to host a Meetup in your area (i.e. a brunch, happy hour, coffee, etc), feel free to let me know and I'll help you get it set up in the group!\n\n**NOTE:** The people on these trips are from all over the States but you\u2019ll always be connected with people from the same city on a trip so you can meet up face to face and get to know your future travel buddies prior to the trip. You\u2019ll also be connected to the whole group via email prior to the trip so you can virtually get to know those that are from different areas. On average, the people on each trip are 90% solo female travelers, but there are sometimes the occasional couple or solo male traveler or couple. Please understand that it\u2019s hard to predict the exact demographic for each trip.\n\nFeel free to join the Facebook group to connect with past travelers on these trips, see pictures, ask questions, funny travel memes, travel-related articles, etc.: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/613025845523107](https://www.facebook.com/groups/613025845523107)\n\nThe trips in this group are put on by a female-owned and -run tour company called Globe Drifters and they focus on small group trips geared towards solo travelers with the mission of giving new meaning to travel by putting the human experience at the heart of their trips. The groups are small, usually with 12 people maximum per trip and about 90% of everyone on each trip are solo female travelers so you\u2019re not stuck being the odd man out on trips with mostly couples. You\u2019ll have the best of both worlds, solo travel with the security of a small group of other solo travelers for some company on your adventure! To contact Globe Drifters directly, you can email [info@globe-drifters.com](mailto:info@globe-drifters.com).",

Prepare yourself for some mid-brow chatter, snacks, and reading. We're aiming for one book a month, democratic voting selection, and wide array of subject matters probably heavily leaning towards fiction. Did I mention the snacks?</p>\n<p>Here are a few useful tips for joining our discussions:</p>\n<p>- You're welcome to join even if you haven't finished the book! &nbsp;Often people who haven't finished find the discussion a helpful motivator to finish things up. &nbsp;The one caveat is, be prepared for spoilers.</p>\n<p>- You're welcome to join even if you're on the wait list. &nbsp;We certainly wouldn't want to turn anyone away.</p>\n<p>- Newcomers are always welcome! &nbsp;We enjoy hearing new points of view and fresh perspectives.</p>\n<p>- Typically we meet at the Democracy Center (45 Mt Auburn St., Cambridge MA) in the Rosa Parks room. &nbsp;The Rosa Parks room is on your right after you walk through the front door on Mt. Auburn St. &nbsp;<span>The Democracy Center is a free, non-profit space that is very generously offering us its space, but doesn't have any food service. &nbsp;So you won't be able to order food or drinks, but feel free to bring your own! &nbsp;We'll also pass the hat for donations to the Democracy Center at the end - so if you could chip in a few bucks, that would be lovely.</span></p>\n<p>- The group is volunteer-run and we definitely encourage members to step up and help out. &nbsp;If you are interested in leading a discussion, joining the organizers group, or organizing a one-off event (like a movie outing, trivia night, author event at a local bookstore, etc.) please get in touch! &nbsp;The more the merrier. <br> <br></p>",

New England has the best seafood on the East Coast, and there are SO many avid fishermen and fisherwomen (fisherpeople) in the area. We just don't know about each other! <br> Fishing enthusiasts have many reasons to band together and go in a group. <br> 1. Share resources- if members go together, they can save on equipment, bait, boats, carpooling, lures, and more!</p>\n<p>2. Share knowledge- What are \"busting fish?\" What are \"slicks?\" What is the correct lure for medium sized saltwater game? When are where can you find small mouthed bass in MA? NH? ME?RI?</p>\n<p>3. Share dinner!!! What is better than grilling your freshly filleted catch with friends at the end of a long day of fishing?</p>\n<p>Members are welcome/encouraged to become Event Planners by contacting (text or phone is best) the Organizer that currently oversees administrative functions (Peter). You may have your own boat/kayak/canoe or can beg/borrow/rent. Ideally, Event Planners should organize a Meetup at least every other month. <br> <br> Anyone who is looking to make and meet new friends in and around the area is welcome to join. Activities are not limited and can vary, depending upon the members interests. This is your group and members are strongly encouraged to voice their ideas and opinions. <br></p>\n<p>Please get involved today. You have been granted the power to suggest new events. Check with your friends to see who else may want to join in the fun. Thanks to Aspen for getting this going! Now, its yours to make what YOU want out of it.</p>\n<p>To get get a new meetup on the calendar, suggest all you need is a Title/Headline, Place and date&amp;time.&nbsp; When 2 more people rsvp yes it's a meetup. Don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries. Its OK. Just put up what you were going to do anyway and see if someone else can join you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

New England has the best seafood on the East Coast, and there are SO many avid fishermen and fisherwomen (fisherpeople) in the area. We just don't know about each other! <br> Fishing enthusiasts have many reasons to band together and go in a group. <br> 1. Share resources- if members go together, they can save on equipment, bait, boats, carpooling, lures, and more!</p>\n<p>2. Share knowledge- What are \"busting fish?\" What are \"slicks?\" What is the correct lure for medium sized saltwater game? When are where can you find small mouthed bass in MA? NH? ME?RI?</p>\n<p>3. Share dinner!!! What is better than grilling your freshly filleted catch with friends at the end of a long day of fishing?</p>\n<p>Members are welcome/encouraged to become Event Planners by contacting (text or phone is best) the Organizer that currently oversees administrative functions (Peter). You may have your own boat/kayak/canoe or can beg/borrow/rent. Ideally, Event Planners should organize a Meetup at least every other month. <br> <br> Anyone who is looking to make and meet new friends in and around the area is welcome to join. Activities are not limited and can vary, depending upon the members interests. This is your group and members are strongly encouraged to voice their ideas and opinions. <br></p>\n<p>Please get involved today. You have been granted the power to suggest new events. Check with your friends to see who else may want to join in the fun. Thanks to Aspen for getting this going! Now, its yours to make what YOU want out of it.</p>\n<p>To get get a new meetup on the calendar, suggest all you need is a Title/Headline, Place and date&amp;time.&nbsp; When 2 more people rsvp yes it's a meetup. Don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries. Its OK. Just put up what you were going to do anyway and see if someone else can join you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "The Long Now Boston Meetup Group is organizationally independent but philosophically aligned with The Long Now Foundation in San Francisco. Recently the Boston Meetup Group received permission to form an independent non-profit in the Boston/Cambridge area using The Long Now Foundation name. A first for Long Now. Stay tuned for developments over the next many months as Long Now Boston begins it new chapter.\u00a0\nThe Long Now Foundation was founded in San Francisco in 01996 (www.longnow.org). As stated on their website: Long Now was established \"to develop the Clock and Library projects, as well as to become the seed of a very long-term cultural institution. The Long Now Foundation hopes to provide a counterpoint to today's accelerating culture and help make long-term thinking more common. We hope to foster responsibility in the framework of the next 10,000 years.\"\nThe Long Now Boston effort was founded by Bill Davison in 02015. We started the Long Now Boston Meetup Group in January 02016. We now have an active Steering Committee and Events Planning subgroups. Our program year typically extends from September through May with an occasional summer event.\n\nJoin us!\n\nView our Code of Engagement [https://bit.ly/EngagementCode](https://bit.ly/EngagementCode)",

        "description": "Are you a mom in or around Boston, MA looking to make friends with other moms? Then you\u2019ve come to the right place!\n\nHi, I\u2019m Louise (37) and I moved to Boston from the UK with my husband and baby (son) in Aug '22. I moved here not knowing a soul and struggled to find inclusive groups where I could make new friends with other likeminded moms and meet up with/without our children on a regular basis - this is why I started this group!\n\nRaising children, whether new to an area or not, can be isolating. I\u2019d love to create a friendly and supportive community where us moms can meet up (with or without our children - your choice) and explore Boston & surrounding areas together whilst going on coffee dates, brunches, walks, play dates, family-friendly excursions and maybe even the odd yoga class?\n\nI would also like to run events which include partners and husbands, because sometimes it\u2019s hard to get a sitter and sometimes we\u2019d just like to socialise as a family\u2026 :)\n\nThey say \u201cit takes a village to raise a child\u201d let's build our own Mom Tribe in Boston together \ud83d\udc95\n\n\\- \\- \\-\nFollow us on Instagram: [@momsaroundboston](Www.Instagram.com/momsaroundboston)\n\nT&C:\nChildren attending any of our meetups & events must have a parent/guardian supervising them at all times; we are not responsible.",

We aim to meet bi-monthly&nbsp;for discussion groups&nbsp;around the Boston area. Everyone is welcome, whether you've been a Thelemite for years or are just hearing about it for the first time and curious what all this stuff means.</p>\n<p><span>Anyone interested in other New Age spiritual practices like Wicca, Shamanism,&nbsp;</span><span>Hermetic Qabalah,</span><span> or Satanism may find something interesting here.</span><br></p>\n<p>Love is the law, love under will</p>",

Members enjoy the following benefits:\n\n\\* Structured field investigations\n\\* Monthly meetings for planning and reporting\n\\* Assistance in conducting individual investigations\n\\* Examination/peer reviewing of evidence\n\\* Online repository for written reports and collected evidence\n\nWe also focus on educating the general public by lecturing, contributing to films, podcasts, or books, and participating in local conventions and fundraising events. \n\nWe take a scientific approach and try to find natural explanations for reported phenomena, while keeping an open mind. Additionally, we attempt to capture verifiable evidence using such tools as Infrared camcorders, EMF meters, Ambient Temperature Sensors, REM Pods, Static Field Meters, Digital Recorders, Thermal Imaging Cameras, Spirit Box/Frequency Sweepers, Motion Sensors, Digital Cameras, and similar technologies. In addition, we recognize the complementary value of psychics, sensitives, mediums, and others, and welcome their assistance. Our members have been featured on SyFy's *Ghost Hunters* and on the Biography Channel.\n\nActive members must reside within the metropolitan Boston area and are expected to contribute $5 monthly dues. Dues are necessary in order to purchase equipment and supply deposits for fee-based investigations. \n\nNo previous experience required, just a serious interest in the paranormal and a commitment to attend monthly meetings and investigations. If you want to ask a question, arrange for a speaker or presentation, or request help with a haunting, please message Laura or Barry directly on Meetup.",

Together we develop our ethical ideals, celebrate life's joys, and support one another through life's crises. We work for the improvement of our world and for the future of our children. Membership is open to those who agree with our principles regardless of race, religion, or national origin. </p>\n<br>\n<p> <br> As ethical humanists, we believe it is important to understand the complexity of modern life. We live in a changing society and we want to help it change in a way that is helpful to humanity. Like traditional religious groups, our values are important in our lives and social actions, but they are not limited by dogma or tradition. <br> <br> The Boston Ethical Community is part of the larger Ethical Culture movement whose member societies are joined together through the American Ethical Union, headquartered in New York, NY, which has about two dozen societies in the U.S. The AEU belongs to the International Humanist and Ethical Union with branches in about 100 countries worldwide. <br> <br> We hold Sunday Platform Meetings at the Longy School of Music Rey-Waldstein Building, Room N1, Cambridge, Massachusetts each Sunday from 10:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. on a more or less academic calendar. Meetings are free and open to the public. Platforms include a featured guest speaker and discussion, readings, and music. We cover a wide range of social, political, environmental, emotional, and interpersonal issues - including matters of war, peace, and justice. <br> <br> We also give a series of short courses called the School for Ethics that explore ethics in society, in personal relationships and in the arts. We present an annual Humanist of the Year Award each Spring. <br> <br> We also have a range of social events, including potluck suppers, nature walks, book discussions, and a movie group.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit our website: <a href=\"http://www.bostonethical.org\">www.BostonEthical.org</a></p>",

We need a minimum of three people to waterski, a waterski boat and of course the waterskis.&nbsp; We encourage you to join even in NH , RI and Western CT and I can help you create Meetups across the region for the most possibilities to waterski close to where you are.</p>\n<p>Who should join? If you have a passion for the water join now! Our members run from Beginners to some of the highest experience levels. Most important, it's a friendly social atmosphere where you can feel comfortable no matter your skill level. We help each other enjoy, learn and get the most out of it. We love people who have have experience waterskiing and/or who can navigate a waterski boat safely and responsibly. It is also great, if you have your waterski boat to add to the group. I expect we will share expenses such as fuel and other incidentals.</p>\n<p>Members are welcome/encouraged to become Event Planners by contacting (text or phone is best) the Organizer that currently oversees administrative functions (Peter). You may have your own a ski boat or can beg/borrow/rent one. Ideally, Event Planners should organize a Meetup at least every other month. <br> <br> Anyone who is looking to make and meet new friends in and around the area is welcome to join. Activities are not limited and can vary, depending upon the members interests. This is your group and members are strongly encouraged to voice their ideas and opinions. <br></p>\n<p>I learned to waterski at seven years old. I still love to do it. <br>I have a boat and skis.&nbsp; Several other members also have their own boats, so there is variety of boats and favorite waterski locations. Borrowing equipment to learn or try is usual, just let us know.</p>\n<p>Where will we meet and Waterski? <br>For freshwater we trailer to nearby Rivers or Lakes such The Merrimac River, Lake Cochiutate, Chebacco Lake.&nbsp; For saltwater, around Boston Harbor or near The Cape, and as far as Newport or Providence RI where the water is warmer. You can review the past meetups for more location details. And keep in mind that we are open to exploring your favorite spot.</p>\n<p> <br>Let's make the best of the days of summer we have here in Boston. Let's get out and waterski!</p>",

Applicants must send me a photo of their vaccination card to have their membership request accepted. Check your Meetup messages after you apply.\n\nI will be posting a variety of tournaments: $80 to $200 buy-in, rebuys, add-ons, deepstacks. All games are in Cambridge, MA with an experienced dealer.\n\nThis is in a non-casino/non-bar setting in a comfortable, organized, clean, friendly environment. Games are structured with House Rules.\n\nHow to apply: Your full name AND a clear, real, recent photo of your face are required to join or you WILL be declined.\n\nI have gone through hundreds of members of my other Meetups who never played a single game for several months, so I\u2019m only accepting members who are ready to play within the next 3 games. This isn\u2019t another Meetup group to add to your long list of groups that you never attend.\n\nNew members who are inactive for over 2 months, i.e. if you never attend a game or log into this site, will be removed.\n\nNo-shows or repeated day-of cancellations will be removed from the group: this affects the prize pool and the waitlist doesn\u2019t get in.",

        "description": "This group provides listening, emotional support and (only if requested) advice on how adults can improve their lives by working through issues created by having Attention Deficit (Hyperactive) Differences/ Disability/ Disorder or ADHD, either \"hyperactive\" or \"inattentive\" type (formerly labeled ADD). Partners, parents (of adults or older teens) with this condition, or other related \"social pragmatic differences\" such as Autism, OCD, PTSD, Bi-polar, Learning Disabilities, etc. -- and most people with ADD or ADHD have at least one other related challenge -- are also welcome. In the past, such non-ADHD loved ones have had their own breakout group, though not in recent years. We meet the first Thursday of each month from 7 to 9 PM Eastern Time -- mostly via Zoom (since the pandemic), but we went hybrid, returning to the Jackson-Mann School/ Community Center near Union Square in Brighton (Boston), MA since July, 2023. However, unless more attenders come to the in-person site by March, 2024, we will go back to all-Zoom.",

My Pomeranian puppy loves dogs of all sizes but he keeps getting trampled by the big guys at the park. I've taken him there hoping to work on his social skills (he's friendly but yappy), but it isn't a good experience when he's accidentally hurt playing with big dogs.</p> \n<p>I thought it would be fun to have a weekly get-together for the small dogs so they can safely play with dogs their own size. The park has separate areas for big and small dogs, but I never see anyone in the small dog area, because there usually aren't enough small dogs at once. Let's get together and get some use out of the small dog section of the park.</p>",

Hire a new employee. Find a job. And.... make new friends!*** ***:oD***\n***In other words:\u00a0 MEET PEOPLE.\u00a0 It's just that simple!***\n***Meaningful*** ***Networking\u2122***\n\n**WHO WE ARE** (and we are the ORIGINAL since 2006!)\nWe are an outgoing and friendly group of people--yes, it really exists in Boston!--of all ages and from all walks of life,\u00a0occupations, and backgrounds.\u00a0Our events are relaxed and have no attitude.\u00a0 Many\u00a0have remarked that we are the \"***un-Club Cafe***.\" In other words, people will be happy to look you in the eye,\u00a0walk over,\u00a0and\u00a0talk to you for a bit!\u00a0 **;o)** And we encourage you to do the same.\n\n**OUR NETWORKING EVENTS**\nWe typically hold 2 networking/social events per month around Boston--usually on\u00a0Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays (and occasionally Fridays too)--sometimes more if there's a special event planned. Attendance\u00a0ranges from 40\u00a0to\u00a0about\u00a070 people (and\u00a0we\u00a0limit attendance to no more than 100, which makes the events more enjoyable for everyone).\u00a0\u00a0**Come join us and make some new friends and professional contacts (like so many others have)!**\n\n**OUR RSVP POLICY**\nThe only thing we ask is that if you RSVP that you're attending, ***please\u00a0be sure to attend***.\u00a0 If your plans change and you can't go, ***kindly\u00a0update your RSVP***.\u00a0 Our events\u00a0occasionally generate waiting lists,\u00a0so if you\u00a0RSVP that you're\u00a0going\u00a0but then don't show, you're taking a spot away from someone who really wants to be there.\u00a0 We\u00a0simply ask that you be considerate of other members.\u00a0 And the places\u00a0where we hold\u00a0events reserve\u00a0space for us and\u00a0often hire extra staff, so it's important to know how many people are actually\u00a0attending.\n\nAlso, please do NOT announce our events\u00a0on social media like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn *etc.* without contacting us first. Feel free to talk about the group there, but we prefer that interested people actually join first given that attendance at the events is limited (and admittance at the door is not always possible).\n\n**PRICE**\nThere is a $10 pre-paid fee to attend our regular evening\u00a0networking events (and we have\u00a0limited-time free events too every so often).\u00a0 However, if you're new to the group, a New England resident, and\u00a0have never been to an event before, **YOUR FIRST EVENT IS\u00a0FREE** so you can check us out (subject to availability and event type). You'll need to e-mail the organizer, Dan, separately\u00a0though so he can put your name on the RSVP list as the Meetup system won't let you RSVP without paying. If you want to attend without pre-registering, then\u00a0it's $15 (cash) at the door.\n\nAlso, *if it's your first free event and you RSVP and then don't show--and don't change your RSVP beforehand either--that still counts as your first event.* Sorry for this strict rule,\u00a0but a\u00a0number of\u00a0folks have tried to take advantage and attend multiple free events by claiming that they never went to their first one.\n\n**MEET PEOPLE!**\nKeep in mind that\u00a0this is a NETWORKING group.\u00a0\u00a0So\u00a0people who come to our events are\u00a0looking to **meet** **other** **people** and not stand around and simply \"be seen.\"\u00a0\u00a0(Again, this is not Club Cafe!)\n\nWhile the organizers and event hosts do their best to\u00a0facilitate introductions and to engage\u00a0others,\u00a0you're expected to go over and\u00a0say \"hi\" to people--and vice versa.\u00a0 *After all, that's why people are there*. If you do, we promise\u00a0that **you won't suddenly burst into flames** . . . and that you **WILL** meet\u00a0some\u00a0friendly\u00a0and approachable folks! **;o)** It only takes a minimal amount of effort on your part to meet some great people and do some really\u00a0*Meaningful Networking*.\u2122\n\nThe group continues to grow through Meetup and by word-of-mouth, which is\u00a0why we've been so successful and why people have been enjoying\u00a0our events since\u00a02006.\u00a0Contrary to popular belief, there really are friendly and welcoming gay venues\u00a0in Boston where people talk to each other!\u00a0 Come by and let us show you....\n***Thanx for taking the time to read about us.\u00a0 We hope you join and\u00a0look forward to seeing you soon!*** **:o)**",

        "description": "<p>Did you take a philosophy class in high school or college and wish you had taken more? Do you read philosophy texts independently but have no one to discuss them with? Then this group is for you.</p><p>The History of Philosophy Boston Meetup is for anyone with an interest in having in-depth discussions about Western/Eastern philosophy, intellectual history, critical theory and more. All backgrounds are welcome! Whether you have a doctorate in the field or are completely self-taught, this group seeks members with an appetite for reading, analyzing and discussing philosophical texts.</p><p>This group will center discussions around a single book by a single author. Potential philosophers will include Plato, Averroes, Confucius, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, Sartre, Arendt, Rawls, Foucault, and Hume. Many of these philosophers are considered \u201ccanonical\u201d (mostly to the Western tradition) but this group is open to including lesser known authors from any culture. To keep things in historical context, we will try to read authors in chronological order. We conducted a recent poll of members on interests. American Philosophy, Continental Philosophy, and Social Theory scored highest as areas of interest, so we'll be focusing on those areas in 2022</p><p>The meetings have moved entirely online since early 2020, so the meetings are open to anyone globally. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Tips in Preparing for Meetings</strong></p><p>After you have finished the reading, ask yourself: (1) What are the philosopher\u2019s principal ideas? (2) What arguments are used to support them, and are they strong or weak? (3) Who were the author\u2019s major influences, and whom in turn did he/she influence? (4) What was the historical context in which the author wrote, and did this affect what was said? (5) Are the author\u2019s works still relevant today and, if so, how?</p><p>To help in answering these questions, attendees are encouraged to consult the secondary resources posted in each announcement. Wikipedia, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy are especially useful.</p><p><strong>Rules of Conduct at Meetings</strong></p><p>Avoid monopolizing the conversation;</p><p>Stay on topic;</p><p>Challenging arguments and disputing facts are fine; personal attacks are not;</p><p>Read least 50% of the recommended selections.</p><p><br /></p>",

        "description": "Welcome! This is an affinity group for those who identify as Highly Sensitive Persons (HSPs). It\u2019s a space where we can meet to discuss the trait and what it means to us. We share our experiences, learn new things, and sometimes gather in-person to enjoy life together.\n\n**What are the meetings like?**\n\nThere are several meeting formats:\n\n1\\. Drop\\-ins \\(Tuesday evenings\\): in\\-person or on Zoom\\, to socialize and learn in a relaxed\\, informal setting\\. It's a great way to recharge after a busy day\\.\n\n2\\. Social outings: dinner\\, nature walk\\, game night\\, etc\\. A fun way to spend an afternoon or evening with friends from the group in a setting that we can all enjoy\\.\n\n3\\. Personal empowerment group: focused discussions around members' personal development goals\\. Bring your life goals and challenges\\, but also curiosity and a whole heart\\.\n\n**What is high sensitivity?**\n\nHigh sensitivity is a trait of human temperament found in 20% of the general population, evenly split between men and women. When HSPs are able to understand themselves deeply and manage their needs accordingly, life in our predominantly non-HSP world can be a lot less challenging than it appears.\n\nConsider the four characteristics that describe the trait:\n\n\\- Depth of processing\\. We reflect more than others would about the past and future\\. We tend to find more meaning in our inner world and in our interconnectedness with others\\. It takes us longer to feel settled after a moving experience\\.\n\n\\- Overarousability\\. We are more easily overwhelmed in stressful or busy situations\\. We get tired faster and have to recharge or take breaks more often\\.\n\n\\- Emotional intensity or empathy\\. We have stronger emotional responses\\, both positive and negative\\.\n\n\\- Sensory sensitivity\\. We have a heightened awareness of subtleties\\. \"Loud\" sounds\\, smells\\, lights\\, etc\\. appear louder than they would for a non\\-HSP\\.\n\nOur intuition and emotional responsiveness grant us access to deeper insights and enable us to be moved more easily by friendships, art, and spirituality. But that openness also means we have to do more work to manage healthy boundaries that help us avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**HSP Resources**\n\nOur book reading list: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1adedweJpf81XKpXg1akxsk1g0OyNPtcx0G5M9IiUQEA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1adedweJpf81XKpXg1akxsk1g0OyNPtcx0G5M9IiUQEA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nTalks on the trait by Elaine Aron\n\nOverview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQLBnUBKggY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQLBnUBKggY)\nOverview and discussion of highly sensitive children: [https://soundcloud.com/highlysensitive/elaine_aron_wellington_nz_2013](https://soundcloud.com/highlysensitive/elaine_aron_wellington_nz_2013)\n\nOther online resources\n\nDr. Aron's website: [http://hsperson.com](http://hsperson.com/)\nHSP Podcast: [http://highlysensitiveperson.net/hsppodcast/](http://highlysensitiveperson.net/hsppodcast/)\nThe Highly Sensitive Badass: [https://thehighlysensitivebadass.com](https://thehighlysensitivebadass.com/)\nQuiet Revolution: [http://www.quietrev.com](http://www.quietrev.com/)\nHighly Sensitive Introvert (Facebook group): [https://www.facebook.com/groups/highlysensitiveintrovert/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/highlysensitiveintrovert/)\nSensitive Evolution (Facebook group): [https://www.facebook.com/groups/158999967969987/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/158999967969987/)\nHSP movies: [https://sensitivethemovie.com/](https://sensitivethemovie.com/)\nCultivating Compassion Training: [http://ccare.stanford.edu/education/about-compassion-cultivation-training-cct/](http://ccare.stanford.edu/education/about-compassion-cultivation-training-cct/)",

We are an inclusive group and welcome all who have SA. Most importantly, this group is about community. We all have something in common. We always strive to provide a welcoming environment.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of activities that we organize: Discussion meetups and Social Activity events. At the discussion meetups , we gather and discuss SA-relevant topics, strategies, and experiences. For the activity events, we venture out into that imposing social world in the form of various fun activities, with the support of our environment at our meetings/events to help people feel more at ease. Participation at an event or meeting is always voluntary. Past events have included ethnic dining, walks, movies, game nights, brunches, museum visits, and hiking. Please note that any member with frequent no-shows or a last-minute cancellations is subject to being changed from the yes list to the waitlist at any event that has a waiting list.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Boston Area Social Anxiety Organizers are not responsible for the well being of any person/member while attending an event. Every member must use their own best judgement and common sense and are wholly responsible for themselves. By joining the Boston Area Social Anxiety Meetup group each member agrees to these rules. </em></strong><em> </em></p><p>Once you join please check out our activity calendar and message board too. Feel free to participate in anything we do! We try to have fun/interesting activities to do despite our SA. We hope to see you soon!</p>",

We have day rides, evening rides, weekend in the mountains or on the Vineyard rides, short rides, long rides, easy rides, advanced rides-something for almost every one.\nWe also get together socially after the rides or at the annual rally and offer workshops where all can learn to fix a flat, adjust the brakes and ride safely and responsibly.\u00a0\nOur purpose is to bring cyclists together in a friendly social atmosphere in which people can acquire new skills and enhance old ones. Our leaders are all volunteers who have mapped out routes on some of the area's most beautiful byways.\u00a0\nMost of our rides provide a lead and a sweep, as well as a cue sheet and/or map. We do our best to keep you on track as well as to keep you safe! Helmets are required on all our rides. We also group rides into easy, intermediate or advanced, so that you can ride with others at a similar pace.\n\nMore information on the AMC Boston Bicycle Committee Website:\nhttps://amcboston.org/amc-boston-chapter-committees/bicycling-committee/\nhttps://amcboston.org/amc-boston-chapter-committees/bicycling-committee/",

        "description": "<p>We are a group of Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and Signers who meet every week to chat in American Sign Language. This group is open to people who speaks American Sign Language. We especially encourage people to come to our group who want to HAVE FUN while socializing with all sorts of different people! This is not a study group nor class! It's a great group for practicing having real conversations in American Sign Language.</p>\n<p>We are a bunch of people who speaks American Sign Language, and who want to get better and better at signing. Some of us want to become interpreters or are in interpreting programs. Others work with Deaf people or have Deaf family members. We have American Sign Language students, pros, and everything in between. Some of us are Deaf and just want to hang out with other fun Deaf, hard-of-hearing, or hearing people who sign. Essentially, we are a social group brought together because we love American Sign Language and we want to have a place where we can socialize, get to know one another, and practice our American Sign Language skills.</p>\n<p><span>Boston Area American Sign Language Meetup welcomes and celebrates diversity in our membership! We do not tolerate audism, racism, sexism, homophobia, or any other type of discriminatory behavior at our meetings.</span></p>\n<p><span>Group rules:</span></p>\n<p><span>1. Sign up as member when you join</span></p>\n<p>2. RSVP when you attend any of our ASL Meetups to make it easy for organizer to keep an record of attendances</p>\n<p><span>3.

        "description": "\\-\\-\\-\\- FIND GREAT LIKE\\-MINDED PEOPLE TO WORK AND BE FRIENDS WITH \\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nIf you want to find a really special community and group of people - sometimes you just have to create it.\n\u00a0\nIf you are looking for something really amazing with great people: Please read the whole description! It will be worth it.\n\nI am starting a network with people who inspire each other. Join our discord (https://discord.gg/XpG5UJzkUu) and join us for amazing small-group coffee chats where we make new friends and pair up to co-work.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- WHO THIS GROUP IS SUITED FOR \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nYou are a great fit if you think of yourself as:\n\n* Being a passionate professional - an entrepreneur, engineer, business person, student, artist... who loves what they do\n* Being inspired\n* Wanting to inspire others; want to meet wholesome people\n* Actively accepting other people for who they are, cherishing differences\n* Not focused on smalltalk and gossip or social expectations but instead looking for meaningful connections\n* simply looking for great friends you share something with\n* want to collaborate or pair program on things\n* open-minded\n* excited to work together on something\n* want to laugh, have fun, and joy at work together\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- WHAT THE PLAN IS \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nWe will meet in a very small group in a cafe. Locations may change throughout Boston but will often be in East Boston, for example Cafe Iterum. Part of the time we will chat, get to know each other, and have fun; part of the time we will work together on things in groups - doesn't matter what, personally I like pair programming or exploring startup ideas, but can be anything - and share our passion for it.\n\nIdeally we will create friendships, business connections who want to work together and recruit each other possibly, maybe even create startups.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- OTHER LOGISTICAL INFOS \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nI will require you to apply for this group, to keep it small. It's first come first serve. But we can either add a wait list, come up with a further way to connect e.g. by creating a discord server and self-organizing, or split into multiple separate meetings so everyone can join. So do reach out to me.\n\nIf you apply to this meetup group, you don't have to prove yourself or something. I'll accept anyone. You only have to tell me that you feel like you fit with what I wrote here. You can copy-paste if you like:\n\"Hey Jesper, I feel like I'd fit well with a group of people you described. Please accept me into the group.\"\n\nKind of a disclaimer: I want this to be like a nice chat over coffee with friends. In normal life, you don't have endless time and pick to have coffee with people you actually like, in most cases.\nTo make this work for now I will set the clear expectation that I decide who joins us and who leaves us, at will. As soon as possible, I will provide an alternative so it's not a problem, like a discord server, where you can just self-organize in any way you want and nobody has to meet with people they don't want to. Also I'll try to structure this more in the future so it's fair and not me arbitrarily deciding, for example by adding a code of conduct and things like that. In the meantime, just want to set expectations that the decision is up to me and I decide not to include people in meetings anymore without giving any reason. Hopefully though this will never happen.\n\nAnother avenue to reach out to me is via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesper-hodge-a57324143/. Never be shy to do so! I love to talk to you whoever you are. I don't have expectations for people.",

(M) your date, or Pass (P) on them.\n\nRepeat.\n\n**Casual dress code.**\n**Prompts.**\n\n\u2192 Dress to impress? We don\u2019t think so. Instead, just be comfortable. Show up in whatever you like to normally wear, whether that\u2019s your Sunday-morning sweats, your favorite snapback, everyday hoodie, or business casual \u2013 it\u2019s totally up to you. No expectations, just be comfortable \ud83d\ude42.\n\u2192 You\u2019ll be on multiple, short(ish) dates \u2013 don\u2019t waste that precious time on formalities! You can catch-up on details later if you both match. Instead, spend your 10-minutes engaging in interesting, in-depth conversation using the prompts that we provide you. This way, you\u2019ll have a great time with each date regardless of the outcome.\n\n**9 rounds.**\n**Longer conversations.**\n\n\u2192 Events are limited to 9 rounds. We believe that this is a sufficient number of rounds to meet a variety of people while avoiding burnout.\n\u2192 While we offer a smaller number of rounds than traditional speed dating events, we provide more time per round \u2013 usually around 10 minutes. This gives participants time to dive into an actual conversation and get to know one another, as opposed to the usual 3-5 minute rounds in traditional speed-dating events.\n\n**FAQ**\n**What is your cancellation/no-show policy? [SERIOUS]**\n\n* Due to the nature of our events, every turnout is critical to the success and experience for all participants. Please read our policy below.\n* Cancellations are non-refundable. Only in special cases such as family emergencies, sickness, or work-related issues will we refund your cancellation (not including the service fee), and this is ONLY if we are notified 72-hours or more in advance of the event. If you decide to cancel, you MUST let us know. Again, cancellations within 72-hours of the start of the event will NOT be refunded for any reason, no exception.\n* No-shows are extremely detrimental to the quality of our events. If you do not show up without any notice or reasoning, you will be charged an additional $50 and may be permanently banned from participating in all future events. We take this extremely seriously because the quality of our events rely on participants showing up. Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this.\n* Leaving in the middle of an event will be considered a no-show.\n\n**What are the ground-rules? [SERIOUS \u2013 PLEASE READ]**\nSafety\n\n* We take the safety of our participants as our number one priority. As our events do not have any physical host present, we coordinate with the venue and their staff to help facilitate an environment that ensures safety and confidence among all participants. Please read below for what is expected of you (as the participant) during our event:\n* You are expected to interact with other participants respectfully while maintaining appropriate boundaries. You will NOT share or provoke personally sensitive information (contact, address, etc.). You will NOT engage with other participants that harms or makes them feel uncomfortable in any way.\n* If you are made to feel uncomfortable by any participant, you will have the ability to report to us immediately.\n* If the event is held at a venue that serves alcohol, you are expected to moderate your alcohol intake so that you can participate in our event without any complication to the other participants, staff, or anyone else at the venue.\n\n**Matching**\n\n* Your contact information will not be shared with any participants at our events UNLESS you have a successful match. In the case of a successful match (you and the other participant indicate \"M\" for each other), then we will share your contact information (email, cell-phone number) ONLY with each other after the event.\n\n**Shuffle is not responsible for any and all interactions beyond and outside of its events.**\nDISCLAIMER OF RESPONSIBILITY\n\n* While Shuffle coordinates to maintain a safe environment, the company cannot guarantee 100% safety when using its service. By using Shuffle, you will interact with other participants face-to-face, interact with 3rd party venues and its staff, and potentially interact with non-participants. The company does not conduct a background check on its participants.\n* Under no circumstances will Shuffle or its affiliates be liable for any damages or harm that may occur to the participant through its services. Shuffle assumes no responsibilities whatsoever for any damages caused to Participants, Non-Participants, Staff, or any Affiliate, of or by any product or service provided by Shuffle.\n\n**What happens if there is an uneven number of participants?**\n\n* We ask all participants for confirmation 1-hour prior to the start of the event. For example, if your event starts at 12pm, we text you at 11am asking for confirmation. By 11:30am, we finalize the list of participants for that Shuffle. If there is an imbalance of participants, then we introduce \u201cbreak-rounds\u201d to substitute for a dating-round.\n* Example: 8 men and 6 women confirm they will participate. The men will each have 6 dates and 2 \u201cbreak-round\u201d \u2013 the women will each have 8 dates.\n\n**I\u2019m 30 years-old but would rather register for the 31-41 bracket. Am I allowed to?**\n\n* Yes! If you are 2 or less years removed from the next age bracket, you are welcome to register for it. So for example, if you are 29 and wish to register for the 31-41 bracket, you are welcome to do so. Likewise, if you are 43 and wish to register for the 31-41 bracket, you may do so as well.\n\n**Are there breaks in-between dates?**\n\n* You get roughly 5-minutes in-between dates (to rate your previous date and to find your next one), so you have plenty of time to go to the restroom or order a(nother) coffee/drink. With that said, we encourage you to show up to the venue early to accommodate for these.\n\n**My date and I found each other a bit early. Can we just start chatting?**\n\n* Yes! If you and your date find each other a few minutes early, just start chatting away.\n\n**I wasn\u2019t able to get a match.**\n\n* You absolutely should not feel down or discouraged! Because the events are limited to 5 dates, it is entirely possible to leave the event without a successful match. You still take away valuable experience and hopefully, fun and interesting conversations. We encourage you to attend more Shuffle's as you are bound to find matches along the way.\n\n**So I give someone a Match! [M]. Now what?**\n\n* Your dates will never see your responses. Instead, if you have successfully matched with a date (both indicated an [M]), we will share your numbers with each other within 24 hours after the event.\n\n**Do I need to keep my phone on the entire time?**\n\n* It isn\u2019t necessary, but we highly encourage you to do so. Since we use text notifications to moderate the entire event, you will be engaging with your phone quite often. We recommend you to leave notifications, vibration, and even sound on so you can react accordingly to our notifications in a timely manner.\n\n**Will my phone automatically subscribe to Shuffle?**\n\n* When you sign up to a Shuffle, we will ask for your permission to send you text notifications leading up to and throughout the event. However, once the event is over, you will no longer receive notifications from us.\n\nQuestions, comments, concerns? Feedback??? Please contact us!\nboston@shuffle.dating",

We plan outings for most of the Fathom/Turner Classic Movies Big Screen Classics series, but also take in other classic film screenings at local cinemas, and always go out for refreshments and discussion after. We recently met Eddie Muller at the Noir City Boston festival in June 2019, and have gathered to appreciate one of our own members curated compilation of 'best of' film clips.

Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. (Average class size: 15-20) Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience.**\n\n**This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the $425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.**\n\n**Zenspeak Public Speaking Center: [https://www.speakeeezi.com](https://www.speakeeezi.com)**\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*30 Years of Testimonials: [https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htm]( https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htm)**\n\n**Once the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose. The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.**\n**This is the 30th year we\u2019ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States.**\n\n**Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready.**\n\n**The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.**\n\n**Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness. But, whatever the challenge, (formal presentation, group discussion, business meeting, sales, confrontation, employment interview) the program is customized to fit your needs.**\n\n**Sample Gradual Exposure Program Outline for Public Speaking Anxiety:**\n**Session One - Get comfortable hearing your voice in public by responding to very simple questions while seated. The questions (i.e., name, occupation, where you live, etc.) require little thought or content.**\n\n**Session Two - Learning to stand confidently before a group. You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.**\n\n**Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.**\n\n**Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.**\n\n**Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.**\n\n**Session Six - Respond to Questions. Open the floor to questions on a topic of choice.**\n\n**Session Seven - Impromptu Speaking. Learn to organize and deliver an unprepared (no notes) talk.**\n\n**Session Eight - Prepared Speech (Instructor Guided). Learn the secret of outlining and presenting a prepared speech with minimal effort or stress.**\n\n**Session Nine - Prepared Speech. Outline and deliver a speech unassisted.**\n**Once you have mastered the above you can begin simulating all manner of interpersonal and public communication including:**\n**Persuasive Speaking**\n\nPanel Discussion\nConflict Resolution\nDefending your Position\nDebating\nInitiating and Sustaining Conversation\nAs well as many others\n**We look forward to working with you.**\n\nWe look forward to your visit",

Whenever it makes sense, we choose a movie from one of those local venues.&nbsp; In addition, on-demand viewing is increasingly available via on-line rental with Hulu, iTunes, YouTube, Amazon Prime and Google Play. Occasionally, other vendors are a source of good movies, as well.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>How This&nbsp;Works</b></p>\n<br>\n<p>Carter, Shirley and John work together to post a Meetup, early in the week.Rental information is explained in the posting.Members screen&nbsp;the film on their own, during the week.There's typically a 48 hour viewing period, from the time you first hit PLAY. ZOOM discussions occur every Saturday night from 7:20-8:50. To everyone who RSVPs, a ZOOM link will appear in a box to the right of the event page, to be used the night of the discussion. That should cover it, for you.&nbsp; We expect this arrangement to last until the lights come back on in adequately coronavirus-free theaters, at which point we'll address the question of where we go from here.&nbsp; Please feel free to reply to this message with your comments, concerns and suggestions.&nbsp; In the meantime, this is fun!&nbsp; We're really pleased at the attendance we're getting and the thoughtful feedback.&nbsp; Let it continue!&nbsp; We hope to \"see\" you this Saturday night.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Yours,S, J, &amp; C</p>",

Through my own experience in singledom that past few years I've learned that both hosting and attending singles events can be an exercise in frustration and disappointment.\nI have since learned what I've known all along. the best way to meet someone and develop a healthy relationship is to get to know them the old fashioned way. You hang out with them for a little while, become friends and take it from there. So without drabbing on about the perils of dating in the new millennium, I just wanted to let you know that I am changing the focus of the group to mimic what I have been doing on the South Shore for a few years.\nYou see the new name above. The focus will be on hosting varied events in the Boston Metro area and beyond, with the sole purpose of having fun and making friends. You don't have to be single to be a member of the group but most of us will be and if romance happens then it's a bonus !\nBut let me be clear, this is not a dating site and I ask everyone to please be respectful and polite of the other members.\nI am always looking for help hosting events and Ideas so please don't be shy. This is just as much your group as it is mine. So let's have some fun.",

        "description": "***Welcome to Boston Wine Meetup Group***!\nThis group is dedicated to all that is wine. Welcome. Whether you are just learning how to hold your glass, are a casual wine drinker, or a passionate expert, we are happy to have you on board.\n\nOur events range from informal tastings at Boston-area restaurants and wine stores, to large formal events, movies, socials, food and wine pairings, dessert wines, reds, whites, ros\u00e9s, Old World vs. New World wines, wine terroir vs. varietals, the language of the label, wine-related travel, lectures, history, cooking with wine...\n\nBostonWine is a \"big-tent\" group, so we welcome anyone and everyone who enjoys the pleasures of table. Come and share a bottle with us.\nthe organizers\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n**BostonWine Group Policies and Disclaimer**\nYou must agree to ALL of our policies to be a member of our group and attend our events.\n\nLEGAL DRINKING AGE REQUIRED\nYou must be of legal drinking age to be a member of our group. By requesting and continuing membership, you swear and affirm that you are over the age of 21. Further, any guests you bring to our events must be 21+ as well. If you intentionally or unintentionally misrepresent your age, or the age of a guest in order to provide alcohol to a person under the age of 21, the organizers will ban you from the group and possibly notify the proper authorities. Please have a photo ID handy when you come to one of our events.\n\nDRUNKENNESS NOT TOLERATED\nDrinking alcohol is a normal activity of this group, but getting drunk is NOT! We expect our members and their guests to know their limits and be responsible wine drinkers. Those who over-indulge to the extent that it disrupts an event, raises safety concerns about the member or others at an event, or potentially presents a liability to the group, will be banned from the group.\n\nBy being a member of BostonWine, you agree that you and your guests will follow the guidance of the organizers if told to stop drinking, need to leave, take a cab or ride from a fellow member, etc. Further, at the discretion of the organizers, the proper venue or legal authorities may be notified in cases of extreme safety concerns.\n\nAUTHORTY OF ORGANIZERS\nThe organizers of BostonWine work hard to create and run great events. In some cases the organizers enter into financial understandings with a venue, supplier, or other third party as part of an event. By requesting membership with BostonWine you acknowledge and accept that the organizers are the only persons with the authority to speak for the group, decide who may or may not be a member of our group, decide what events to plan and how to run them. In particular, you agree that the organizer of an event has final authority on how the event is to proceed, what adjustments might have to be made during the event to ensure it is a success, what constitutes proper behavior and generally how to maintain order.\n\nPROPER BEHAVOR\nBostonWine events generally are casual, educational and fun. We expect all members to behave as responsible adults and show respect for other members, their opinions, similarities as well as their differences. If an issue arises with another member, staff at a meetup venue, or on the group's web site, you agree to notify the organizers and let him/her handle the situation. Further, you agree under no circumstance to argue or otherwise get into a dispute with another person during an event.\n\nThe consumption of alcoholic beverages may impair one's judgments or actions to act responsibly. If a member participates in any action that the organizer deems is harmful or threatening to themselves, another person, animal or property, or whose behavior reflects poorly on BostonWine, that member will be banned from the group.\n\nOur discussion boards, event comments, etc. are not forums for airing personal disputes, and doing will result in your removal from the group. Using our web site to distribute email virus or other malware is a crime and will be reported to proper legal authorities.\n\nFINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nMembers are responsible for paying their own way and settling their tab before leaving a meetup in a restaurant or other venue where a group tab was open.\n\nGOVERNMENT WARNING ON HEALTH CONSEQUENCES of CONSUMING ALCOHOL\nThe organizers and our members believe that moderate consumption of wine with food is part of a healthly lifestyle. However, alcohol consumption is ill advised for certain people in certain circumstances. By joining BostonWine, you acknowledge that there is a government warning concerning the health effects of consuming alcoholic beverages: (1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.\n\nMUST HAVE A PROFILE PHOTO\nTo join or remain in this group ALL Members are required to have a representative main profile photo at all times. A head shot is best, but not required. You will not be able to join without a photo and will be removed for lack thereof. We do this to ensure the safety of our members, but also to simplify the lives of the organizers.\n\nPUBLIC IMAGES\nFrom time to time, members take photographic, digital or video images of event participants and post these images to our web site. You hereby agree to allow the BostonWine group to display those images without expectation of privacy or remuneration. Members are free to request, however, that a particular image of themselves be removed by contacting one of the organizers; final determination of whether the image should be removed however is at the discretion of the organizer.\n\nNO_SHOW POLICY\nMost of our events have wait lists due to their popularity. Not showing up to an event that you have RSVP'd to is disrespectful to your fellow members, makes it difficult for the organizer to plan events and may incur financial penalties. As a result, after 3 \"no-shows,\" the organizer may decide to remove you from the group.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nBy being a member of the BostonWine group you hereby agree to assume all risks and liability related to or resulting from any and all group events, interactions with our meetup web site and other members. You agree that neither you nor any third party will hold any of the group's organizers, members, companies, officers, or representatives liable for any injury, loss, or damage to yourself, your guests or any members of your family, friends, acquaintances, children, pets, or property, arising directly or as a consequence from a group activity.\n\nDuring all events, everyone is responsible for themselves. The organizers are not responsible for the safety of the participants. We will try our best to prevent accidents, but are not responsible or liable if something happens to you. Be aware of your limits and respect your fellow group members; DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE.\n\nBy joining the BostonWine meetup group and remaining a member, you acknowledge and accept these points.\n\nThanks,\nthe organizers",

It's the next level of Resistance/Werewolf-style social deduction games and is extremely addictive! Boston recently received a pre-release copy, and we are running regular game nights for those who delight in deduction and deception.</p>\n<p>Each game lasts about an hour and many games are played in a single session, so feel free to drop by for one, some, or all games in a night. Try out your best tricks and charms as you make new friends \u2014 and then accuse them of murder.</p>\n<p>BOTC differs from existing social bluffing games. Every player has an individual role that is powerful, knows something, or comes with a unique challenge, and those abilities may malfunction unexpectedly! No two players or games are ever alike. The game also has a moderator who runs the game, disseminates information (and misinformation!), and ensures that every game is different, interesting, and filled with nail-biting tension. Players stay on as influential ghosts even if they die, and may even enter a game after it starts as powerful \"Travellers\".</p>\n<p>You can find out more about the game at <a href=\"http://bloodontheclocktower.com/\">bloodontheclocktower.com</a>. New events and other announcements are made on our various social media outlets, which can be found on <a href=\"https://botc-boston.com/\">botc-boston.com</a>. <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>",

Should sufficient interest appear in the future, I will consider reviving it. And feel free to message me until then.\nBest, Eric.\n\nHere is my original Group description:\n\nLife circumstances can leave adults isolated, without a support network, and even overwhelmed in Greater Boston. Ageing, illness, trauma, estrangement, extremes of introversion and shyness are some of those happenstances. A Zoom video chat forum provides an obvious opportunity for remedy. Rather than the casual, unfocused and random chat groups online, this one is a chance to address those circumstances in a serious way, to tell of the conditions that left us isolated, and through a gathering of persons focused on the vital connections and support network that good friends afford us, to attain a quality of life enjoyed by those less socially compromised.\n\u00a0\nMeeting frequency will be based on demand and keeping the number of attendees manageable, and will be conducted in English. Group privacy will be private, and members will cover only the minimal cost of any Meetup's Group/Zoom charges.\n\u00a0\nAgain, I imagine a place where those more urgently, not casually, in need of support specific to loneliness and isolation have an opportunity to once again enjoy the relief, healing and growth among friendly people that all persons deserve.",

Should sufficient interest appear in the future, I will consider reviving it. And feel free to message me until then.\nBest, Eric.\n\nHere is my original Group description:\n\nLife circumstances can leave adults isolated, without a support network, and even overwhelmed in Greater Boston. Ageing, illness, trauma, estrangement, extremes of introversion and shyness are some of those happenstances. A Zoom video chat forum provides an obvious opportunity for remedy. Rather than the casual, unfocused and random chat groups online, this one is a chance to address those circumstances in a serious way, to tell of the conditions that left us isolated, and through a gathering of persons focused on the vital connections and support network that good friends afford us, to attain a quality of life enjoyed by those less socially compromised.\n\u00a0\nMeeting frequency will be based on demand and keeping the number of attendees manageable, and will be conducted in English. Group privacy will be private, and members will cover only the minimal cost of any Meetup's Group/Zoom charges.\n\u00a0\nAgain, I imagine a place where those more urgently, not casually, in need of support specific to loneliness and isolation have an opportunity to once again enjoy the relief, healing and growth among friendly people that all persons deserve.",

If we could offer it for less, we would\u2014because we believe everyone deserves accessible healing options.\n\n**Important note**: This group is a complementary space to professional one-on-one therapy, not a replacement. If you are in crisis, please reach out to the appropriate resources, such as calling 988.\nWe\u2019re excited to meet you and start creating meaningful, expressive art together!\n\n**Check out our upcoming sessions and sign up here**: [Classes List | Hobi](gethobi.com)\n\nBe kind to yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for more information.",

Sometimes we go to bigger events that make you feel lost or nervous. Call or text my cell if you feel lost 617-939-6509.\nPeople come and go and there's always new people at every event. Sometimes no one RSVPs and 10 people show up. Sometimes 10 people RSVP and no one shows up. Just come hang out when you feel like it, and if you get overstimulated and have to walk away that's perfectly ok. No one will judge.",

        "description": "[Profs and Pints](https://www.profsandpints.com/) brings professors and other college instructors into bars, cafes, and other venues to give fascinating talks or to conduct instructive workshops. They cover a wide range of subjects, including history, politics, popular culture, horticulture, literature, creative writing, and personal finance. Anyone interested in learning and in meeting people with similar interests should join. Lectures are structured to allow at least a half hour for questions and an additional hour for audience members to meet each other. **Admission to Profs and Pints events requires the purchase of tickets, either in advance (through the link provided in event descriptions) or at the door to the venue. Many events sell out in advance.**\n\nAlthough Profs and Pints has a social mission--expanding access to higher learning while offering college instructors a new income source--it is NOT a 501c3. It was established as a for-profit company in hopes that, by developing a profitable business model, it would be able to spread to other communities much more quickly than a nonprofit dependent on philanthropic support. That said, it is welcoming partners and collaborators as it seeks to build up audiences and spread to new cities. For more information email profsandpints@hotmail.com .\nThank you for your interest in Profs and Pints.\nRegards,\nPeter Schmidt, Founder, Profs and Pints",

        "description": "Looking to join a group to play some escape games in Greater Boston and beyond? Lock yourself in here with us, then!\n\nNever played an escape room before? Never fear! We welcome both the experienced and first timers in our group! It takes all kinds of mindsets for escape rooms, and often new players bring something to the table as much as the experienced do. It's also a great way to meet people and make friends!\n\nFor the uninitiated: Escape rooms, or escape games, are exciting hour-long adventure games that take place in rooms full of puzzles and mysteries. You and a squad of people work together to find clues and solve said puzzles, to try and escape before time runs out!\n\nWe meet up, have some food and drinks before or after, and have a great time cracking these rooms. Whether you're new or old to escape rooms, try one of our meetups this month!\n\nOur mission is to:\n\n\\-\\- Support local escape room businesses\n\\-\\- Help others find people to play escape rooms with\n\\-\\- Bring the community together and create friendships\n\nOur group is sponsored by Morty, an app dedicated to tracking, searching and booking escape rooms! Built by enthusiasts for all who love escape rooms! You can join the app right now with this link: [https://link.morty.app/meetup](https://link.morty.app/meetup)\n\nCheck out our discord and join in on the discussion here: [https://discord.gg/f4gze5pRWN](https://discord.gg/f4gze5pRWN)\n\n**REFUND POLICY**\nWe will try to accommodate refunds, but it's up to the escape room venue. Generally speaking, more than a few days in advance we can handle a refund and within 24 hours it's not possible. To see the exact refund policy for an experience please check the venue's website!\n\n**PAYMENT POLICY**\nPayments are due two weeks before the event starts. We'll send reminders out as the date comes closer. If no payment is made at the two-week mark, you will be removed from the RSVP list to allow room for others to join due to the limited number of spots available.\n\n**RULES FOR A SUCCESSFUL ESCAPE ROOM**\n**See Something, Say Something**\nCommunication is absolutely vital for solving an escape room. Most rooms are designed so that everyone can be working on something or discovering something new all at the same time, so if you don\u2019t communicate, you might not catch some missing pieces! Nothing is worse than someone who finds something and just keeps it in their pockets. That slows us down and makes others frustrated.\n\n**Don\u2019t Take Over the Room**\nLeadership is so important, but there\u2019s nothing worse than someone who totally takes over. Not only is this no fun for everyone playing, it\u2019s also going to cause you to make mistakes and slow down your team. If you are the natural leader in your team, that\u2019s great! Just make sure you remember that you need your WHOLE team to succeed.\n\n**Pass the Baton**\nIf you\u2019ve been staring at a puzzle for too long and can\u2019t figure out the solution, enlist a fellow team member to help or take over on the puzzle. This helps make sure that puzzles don\u2019t get forgotten, and that there are enough eyes on each unsolved puzzle. This can continue until a few people can\u2019t figure it out \u2013 that\u2019s usually a sign that you don\u2019t have all of the information yet (or that you need a hint!).\n\n**Be a Contributor, not a Spectator**\nIt\u2019s too easy to be a spectator when interesting progress is being made on a puzzle, but people are more effective when they\u2019re spread out and working on what needs to be done! If there\u2019s only one puzzle open however, by all means let the whole team brainstorm. On the contrary point \u2013 if someone is intently focusing on accomplishing a single task (e.g. entering a combo into a school-style combination lock), resist the urge to chime in, or yell over others that are giving the answer to a puzzle.\n\n**Silence is Golden (Sometimes)**\nSometimes, it\u2019s important to stay quiet when listening for hints, clues, or when narration during the escape room occurs. When this is happening, keep your voice and whatever puzzles you may be trying to solve at a minimum.\n\nFor more tips and tricks check out the [Morty Blog](https://morty.app/blog)\n\n\\*Please follow these rules in order for us to have fun at each escape room. Members who repeatedly break these rules will be restricted as to how many rooms they are allowed to attend and/or asked to leave the group",

        "description": "<p><b>WHO ARE WE?</b></p>\n<br>\n<p>We started off as a dissident band of renegades from the Boston Social Strategy Gamers group (OK, many of us are members of that group, too -- but still) who were in search of fellow fans of gamer's games -- broadly speaking, stuff with more complexity and/or a nastier streak than you get from <b>Settlers of Catan </b>or <b>Ticket to Ride</b>. Since then, we've grown dramatically (close to 200 members at the time of this writing) and we have Meetup events to play all sorts of stuff. We're open to anyone with a good attitude and an interest in strategic tabletop gaming -- though being the sort of person not scared off by rulebooks with more than eight pages doesn't hurt.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>WHAT DO WE DO?</b></p>\n<br>\n<p>In addition to an event almost every Wednesday in Porter Square, Cambridge, we periodically host get-togethers to play games we're interested in at various places -- time and availability permitting. All of our events are free and open to anyone who's interested unless otherwise noted. Newcomers are always welcome at our events; you don't need to be an expert in the games we play. A good attitude and a willingness to learn is all that is necessary.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We have a once-per-month session of 18XX games, and a kinda-sorta-once-per-month session of multi-player wargames. Apart from the longer time commitment, these events are like the others; everyone is welcome, including newcomers willing to learn the ropes.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We also have running online competitions for the games <b>Brass </b>and <b>Through The Ages</b>. Newcomers are welcome to be a part of these as well, and you can play them from the convenience of your own homes.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>WHERE DO WE MEET?</b></p>\n<br>\n<p>We're a pretty urban lot, so the vast majority of our events are in the Boston/Cambridge/Somerville/Watertown/Brookline/Newton area. If this area is inconvenient for you, you are welcome to suggest an event for a venue more convenient for you; we just can't guarantee you'll get a big turnout.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>WHAT IS A \"CUBE CARTEL GAME?\"</b></p>\n<br>\n<p>Basically, it's what you make of it.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We started out as a group to get together and play \"heavier\" examples of \"Euro\" (or \"German-style\") board games (think <b>Agricola </b>or <b>Age of Steam</b>) and that is still probably the majority of what we play. But, as mentioned, we also play some 18xx (complex, nasty \"business\" games with a railroad theme, like <b>1830: Railroads and Robber Barons</b>) and some wargames (especially GMT's card-based wargames, like <b>Twilight Struggle</b> and <b>Virgin Queen</b>).</p>\n<br>\n<p>What we don't play much of: classic strategy games (like <b>Chess</b>, <b>Go </b>or <b>Mancala</b>), super-popular mass-market games (like <b>Monopoly</b>, <b>Risk </b>or <b>Clue</b>), traditional card games (like <b>Poker</b>, <b>Scopa </b>or <b>Bridge</b>), role-playing games (like <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b>) and collectible card games (like <b>Magic: The Gathering</b>). There are people in our group that like these sorts of games, and no one's going to give you a noogie if you suggest playing them, but they're not the focus of the group and are thus unlikely to make it to the table. There are some excellent local Meetups if you're interested in any of these.</p>\n<br>\n<p>In the end, we're less interested in drawing a bright-line distinction between what is and what is not a Cube Cartel Game than we are in playing what we like. The real purpose of this group is to be a sort of \"safe space\" where no one's going to look at you like an uberdork for pulling out your copy of<b> Le Havre </b>or <b>Chicago Express</b>.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Thanks for checking us out. We hope you'll join us soon.</b></p>",

        "description": "<p><b>WHO ARE WE?</b></p>\n<br>\n<p>We started off as a dissident band of renegades from the Boston Social Strategy Gamers group (OK, many of us are members of that group, too -- but still) who were in search of fellow fans of gamer's games -- broadly speaking, stuff with more complexity and/or a nastier streak than you get from <b>Settlers of Catan </b>or <b>Ticket to Ride</b>. Since then, we've grown dramatically (close to 200 members at the time of this writing) and we have Meetup events to play all sorts of stuff. We're open to anyone with a good attitude and an interest in strategic tabletop gaming -- though being the sort of person not scared off by rulebooks with more than eight pages doesn't hurt.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>WHAT DO WE DO?</b></p>\n<br>\n<p>In addition to an event almost every Wednesday in Porter Square, Cambridge, we periodically host get-togethers to play games we're interested in at various places -- time and availability permitting. All of our events are free and open to anyone who's interested unless otherwise noted. Newcomers are always welcome at our events; you don't need to be an expert in the games we play. A good attitude and a willingness to learn is all that is necessary.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We have a once-per-month session of 18XX games, and a kinda-sorta-once-per-month session of multi-player wargames. Apart from the longer time commitment, these events are like the others; everyone is welcome, including newcomers willing to learn the ropes.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We also have running online competitions for the games <b>Brass </b>and <b>Through The Ages</b>. Newcomers are welcome to be a part of these as well, and you can play them from the convenience of your own homes.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>WHERE DO WE MEET?</b></p>\n<br>\n<p>We're a pretty urban lot, so the vast majority of our events are in the Boston/Cambridge/Somerville/Watertown/Brookline/Newton area. If this area is inconvenient for you, you are welcome to suggest an event for a venue more convenient for you; we just can't guarantee you'll get a big turnout.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>WHAT IS A \"CUBE CARTEL GAME?\"</b></p>\n<br>\n<p>Basically, it's what you make of it.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We started out as a group to get together and play \"heavier\" examples of \"Euro\" (or \"German-style\") board games (think <b>Agricola </b>or <b>Age of Steam</b>) and that is still probably the majority of what we play. But, as mentioned, we also play some 18xx (complex, nasty \"business\" games with a railroad theme, like <b>1830: Railroads and Robber Barons</b>) and some wargames (especially GMT's card-based wargames, like <b>Twilight Struggle</b> and <b>Virgin Queen</b>).</p>\n<br>\n<p>What we don't play much of: classic strategy games (like <b>Chess</b>, <b>Go </b>or <b>Mancala</b>), super-popular mass-market games (like <b>Monopoly</b>, <b>Risk </b>or <b>Clue</b>), traditional card games (like <b>Poker</b>, <b>Scopa </b>or <b>Bridge</b>), role-playing games (like <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b>) and collectible card games (like <b>Magic: The Gathering</b>). There are people in our group that like these sorts of games, and no one's going to give you a noogie if you suggest playing them, but they're not the focus of the group and are thus unlikely to make it to the table. There are some excellent local Meetups if you're interested in any of these.</p>\n<br>\n<p>In the end, we're less interested in drawing a bright-line distinction between what is and what is not a Cube Cartel Game than we are in playing what we like. The real purpose of this group is to be a sort of \"safe space\" where no one's going to look at you like an uberdork for pulling out your copy of<b> Le Havre </b>or <b>Chicago Express</b>.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Thanks for checking us out. We hope you'll join us soon.</b></p>",

It is a branch of the Sufi Order International, an interfaith international organization.</p>\n<p><em>\"Thus the ultimate purpose for which the soul is seeking every moment of our life, is our spiritual purpose. And you may ask how to attain to that purpose. The answer is that what you are seeking for is within yourself. Instead of looking outside, you must look within. The way to proceed to accomplish this is for some moments to suspend all your senses such as sight, hearing, smell, touch, in order to put a screen before the outside life; and by concentration and by developing that meditative quality you will sooner or later get in touch with the inner self which is more communicative, which speaks more loudly than all the noises of this world; and this gives joy, creates peace, and produces in you a self-sufficient spirit, a spirit of independence, of true liberty.\"</em> -- Hazrat Inayat Khan</p>",

        "description": "<p>Augmented Reality is a description used for technology that looks to enhance a user's understanding, pleasure, and engagement with real-world environment they are in. It could take the form of augmented reality glasses, it could be an app on a phone or tablet, or it could even be ear buds that actively filter the sound around you and change your perception of reality. There are many ways to enhance a person's sensory experience of the world around them, and all of these ways fall under the \"augmented reality\" umbrella.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>At first glance it is similar to Virtual Reality, but actually quite different. VR looks to immerse the user in a completely separate environment from the one they are in, whereas AR, as just described, wants the user to more firmly be rooted in their world. As the technologies mature, it makes sense to have a meetup dedicated solely to augmented/mixed reality technologies and conversations. Our goal is not to cannibalize the community, but rather to provide another opportunity for enthusiasts to engage with each other, and for tinkerers and startups to show off their demos for feedback.</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>This meetup group is open to ANYONE who is interested in Augmented Reality. You don't have to be a developer to join. In fact, we actively encourage all members of the community to participate, from artists to developers to business-minded people to gamers to students to those who just want to learn more.</p>",

        "description": "**Welcome to the TypeDB Developer Community!**\n\n[TypeDB](https://typedb.com) is a [polymorphic](https://typedb.com/features#polymorphic-queries) database with a [conceptual](https://typedb.com/features#conceptual-modeling) data model, a strong [subtyping](https://typedb.com/features#strong-type-system) system, a symbolic [reasoning](https://typedb.com/features#symbolic-reasoning) engine, and a beautiful and elegant [type-theoretic](https://typedb.com/features#modern-language) language TypeQL.\n\n**Background**\n\nOver the last decade, we have seen modern programming languages have evolved by introducing powerful abstractions and constructs to express more complex logic\u200a\u2014\u200aJavaScript is being succeeded by TypeScript, Python by Julia, Java by Kotlin, C/C++ by Rust, and Haskell emerged as the leader of functional languages. Modern languages all have stronger and more powerful abstractions, as they leverage a breadth of powerful concepts in modern mathematics: type theory -- the study of type systems and how they formally govern complex and logical systems.\n\nHowever, when we look at the evolution of database technologies since relational algebra and SQL, even though there has been incredible progress in performance and operational capabilities in the past 40 years, databases have yet to provide more powerful abstractions to express more advanced logic. Database models have failed to keep up with the rapid evolution of programming languages and their abstractions, and modern applications must use complex, layered architectures to manage their data. Relational databases lack the expressivity to model polymorphism, and eliminating the schema in NoSQL databases prevents declarative data retrieval.\n\nInspired by the advancement of modern programming languages, we ask ourselves: with modern type-theoretic mathematics at our disposal, how would we re-think and re-design the foundations of modern databases in the best possible way?\n\nAnswering the question above allowed us to build the world's first truly polymorphic database, powered by a strong type system and a native reasoning engine. For the first time, TypeDB brings to the database the power of polymorphic abstractions, the simplicity of a composable language, and the intelligence of symbolic reasoning to infer data.\n\n**About this community**\n\nIn this developer community, we will discuss new and modern paradigms in database engineering: conceptual data modeling, strong subtyping systems, symbolic reasoning, polymorphic queries, and truly declarative, modern, and type-theoretic query language. We will discuss how TypeDB allows software engineers to build more advanced database applications with an elegant and robust database language.\n\n**Developer resources**\n\nTypeDB Learning Center: [typedb.com/learn](https://typedb.com/learn)\nTypeDB Discord Server: [typedb.com/discord](https://typedb.com/discord)\nTypeDB GitHub: [github.com/typedb](https://github.com/vaticle/typedb)\nTypeDB YouTube: [youtube.com/@typedb](https://youtube.com/@typedb)",

        "description": "<p>I wanted to start a more informal meetup group for people of all hiking experiences. I tried joining a few other meetups, but there's always strict rules of gear that are required, or paid hikes, attendance checking, etc. I used to belong to a hiking group in Boston before Meetups, where members would just post a hike that they're planning, and some info about the hike, its difficulty level, what's expected on the hike, etc. And others could join the hike responsibly, taking care of packing their gear appropriately, arrange carpools with other members and split the cost for gas, etc. I moved away from Boston for 12 years, and now I'm back and wanted to meet people for hikes again.</p>\n<p>So, this group is for anyone who is interested in hiking in the New England area based in Boston... mostly I'll arrange hikes to NH and VT... but anyone who is a member can arrange a hike. Just PM or email me with the hike info and I will post. Members who are going to the hike should make arrangements for carpool, etc among themselves. </p>\n<p>The only requirement is that you should be responsible hikers and respectful of other members. This does not mean that it's free for all; go without any gear or safety concerns.&nbsp; This means you should have common sense on what to pack and make sure you only attend hikes that are within your fitness level... and if you're not sure, reach out to the person arranging the hike to clarify, etc.&nbsp; Members who do not show respect to others will be dismissed from the group.</p>",

I don't have children, so want to spend my weekends doing other stuff. I wanted to bring together women who might be in a similar situation\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\u25cf Just so folk understand the rationale for the age here, there are sooooo many fantastic groups on meetup for 45+ years, as both women and mens groups. Am just filling a gap which I've fallen into \ud83d\ude14 It's absolutely not personal \ud83d\ude4f\n\n\u25cf Hope folk are OK splitting the bill - this is an easy going group of professionals, so hope this works.",

We have no boring events like the snoozefest meditations with guides who won\u2019t shut up about your elbow's position.\n\nEvery thoughtful, restorative, mindful good time involves something high-energy you\u2019d actually want to do [such as pirate yoga nights, 80s nights, disco nights, country western nights, Hawaiian hot tub meditations, board games, cooking parties, ski trips, dinner parties, friendly competitions, exploring new places, ranking the best hot tubs in the city, and more!]\n\nShow up with no yoga/meditation experience needed - our events are designed for all levels. Join us for memorable and enjoyable yoga and mindfulness experiences! Events are hosted at my place in Somerville, local fitness studios/gyms, and unique venues like distilleries or zoos.\n\nI started this group because I was looking for an easy, fun way to chill out more without it feeling like work, and I felt overwhelmed by the meditative wellness groups where things felt overly serious or religious. As a new professional yoga/meditation instructor, I've loved meeting people and helping them find inner peace through silly and relaxed methods. My goal is to create a community where you'd want to hang out even outside of Meetups.\n\nCome hang out with me and some like-minded new friends, and let\u2019s find ways to get our peace on, together.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nThis Meetup group is brought to you by Peace Out Ski + Wellness Club, a high-energy mindfulness and skiing club for millennials aiming to unwind and feel alive. I host unique yoga nights & meditation parties year-round in the Boston area, with cool themes like Pirates and Hawaiian Luaus, plus winter ski & meditation retreats all over New England. Have fun finding mindfulness in chill cozy settings that feel like hanging out at your best friend's apartment.

We schedule golf events around Eastern Massachusetts every weekend as well as many social-only get togethers in the off season.\n\u00a0\nASGA Boston is a non-competitive, 45+, social group, but some prior experience in playing the game and some level of golfing etiquette is expected. We\u2019re trying to keep the pace of play at around 4-1/2 hours. \u00a0Ready golf!!\u00a0 Single golfers from all player levels, experienced beginner to expert, are welcome to join us!\n\n*Meet Up* is a tool we use to announce Chapter events and to let singles know more about us.

To forego this cost, go to our website to join as an official member.\n\u00a0\n**Membership**\nThe Boston Chapter membership is growing. To join ASGA, please visit our national website at **[www.singlesgolf.com](http://www.singlesgolf.com)** . The current annual dues are $99.00.

We explore different sauna and steam rooms in Boston and get an opportunity to meet new people with similar interest in wellness and health.\n\nSauna and steam bath has great benefits to the body. Sweating by heat of a sauna dilates blood vessels, increasing blood circulation and reduces muscle tension. Sweating in a sauna removes toxins, dead skin, and other byproducts from your body. Saunas may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases. Saunas hemp you relive body pain and can help you relax physically and mentally, which can help you fall and stay asleep. This can help reduce stress and improve quality of life.",

        "description": "This group is intended for creative writers of **prose fiction** 18-35 who are dedicated to improving their craft and supporting their fellow writers. This is a workshop group that meets every 2-3 weeks to critique 2-3 submissions from fellow group members. The fee is $2/meeting, strictly to offset the cost of hosting the group on Meetup.com.\n\nAll genres of prose fiction are welcome! Short stories? Awesome! Novel excerpts? Excellent! Meetings are online on Discord.\n\nIf you would like to join, please fill out the questions on the membership request. **Note that we do not critique poetry or nonfiction pieces.** This is an inclusive and LGBTQ+ friendly group and we welcome people from all backgrounds and skill levels!\n\nPlease read through our group rules:\n1\\. Submissions should be double\\-spaced and \\~25 pages\\. Please include page numbers and preface your piece explaining what it is \\(a completed story? an excerpt?\\) and what you would like us to focus on in our critique\\.\n\n2\\. Our critique format is the following: First everyone but the author will discuss the piece for about \\~15 minutes\\. The author should remain quiet unless we ask them a question or something important needs to be clarified\\. Afterwards everyone will be free to address the author\\, give direct feedback\\, ask the author questions\\, etc\\. for another \\~15 minutes\\.\n\n3\\. Please attend at least one meeting before submitting a piece\\. It's good for new folks to get a sense of what the group is about and to contribute to the community\\.\n\n4\\. We really value the community we've built with this group\\, and we put a lot of time and effort into helping each other grow as writers\\. To that end\\, please don't **only** show up to meetings when your piece is being critiqued. Be willing to put as much time and effort into other people's work as we put into yours!\n\n5\\. To allow more people to get a chance to have their work critiqued\\, please do not sign up for critique more than two meetings in a row\\. \\(The exception to this is if we're really in a squeeze for submitters\\-\\-if you're not sure\\, ask\\!\\)\n\n6\\. Please do not call dibs on submitting before the next meeting is announced\\. If you sign up but then have to back out unexpectedly\\, please let the group know as soon as possible\\.\n\n7\\. Sorry\\, no one under 18\\!\n\n8\\. Please RSVP and shoot a message through the site or Discord if you're running late\\. \n\n9\\. We don't have any set limits on sensitive content/gore/language\\, but use good judgment and be cognizant that your fellow writers come from all backgrounds\\. I reserve the right to decline a writer's submission if necessary \\(for example\\, if a submission is just blatant hate speech\\)\\, but so far it's never happened\\.\n\n10\\. Not sure why you'd want a critique on something you didn't write\\, but for the record: no AI\\-generated content\\.\n\n11\\. Stay cool and keep writing\\! \ud83d\ude0e",

Thinking about joining a CSA? Maybe considering a tomato plant on your balcony this spring? How bout a new compost bin for your backyard? Maybe you work on or own a farm in Massachusetts? Or sit on the board of a an urban non-profit that brings produce to people in need......or you're a policy student, interested in finding ways of lobbying for the small organic food producers. We're all members of a community of food-lovers!! So let's get together and do what we do best - eat!</p>",

Investing is a beautiful art in which when conducted correctly, can lead to a much happier and more fulfilling life with less financial worries.\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Meetup group is for finance beginners and underprivileged individuals to learn how to invest and discuss their investment ideas with each other. You will learn about stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, etc. in addition to friendly debating which stocks are hot and which are not.\n\n\n\n\n*About Us:* We love investing, and we are constantly pushing ourselves to learn more about it. We graduated from Harvard and Brown respectively, and have been obsessed with investing ever since. We can share our experiences working at Fortune 100 companies, flurrying on the chaotic trading floor, watching the bell ring at the New York Stock Exchange, and meeting financial gurus such as Jim Cramer, Kevin O'Leary, etc. We cannot wait to talk about investing over coffee, make new friends, and learn from each other.",

This includes anyone from total beginners looking to experiment to classically trained musicians: synthesizer geeks (software or hardware!), hardware experimentalists, gear fetishists, IDM enthusiasts, noise and drone heads, techno/EDM lovers, and everything in between! Would love to talk to other similarly-minded queer folk about software, gear, effect pedals, plug-ins, favorite artists, production techniques, and so on. We could even plan cool shows to go to and even collaborate on music together. I am personally not a classically trained musician and just mess with audio samples on Ableton to make weird ambient/experimental stuff, but I'm always looking to branch out.\n\nIf you have ANY interest in the following music, please reach out: Actress, Akira Rabelais, Arca, Burial, The Caretaker, Chino Amobi, Anthony Naples, Holly Herndon, Patrick Cowley, Tim Hecker, Jon Hopkins, Bernard Parmegiani, SOPHIE (RIP), Ulla, Vessel, Yves Tumor, Autechre, Octo Octa, Mika Vainio, Foodman, Dedekind Cut, Coil, Aphex Twin, Blawan, Bjork, Traumprinz, Brian Eno, Oneohtrix Point Never, Huerco S, The Knife, Klein, HTRK, Andy Stott, Peverelist, Jake Muir, Merzbow, Lussuria, Vladislav Delay, Perila, Felicia Atkinson, Pontiac Streator, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Alva Noto, Biosphere, Hieroglyphic Being, Shygirl, Sunn 0))), Mica Levi, The Field, Eliane Radigue, Kevin Drumm, Stars of the Lid, William Basinski, Lyra Pramuk, Jlin, Baauer, Deathprod, Colin Stetson, C Spencer Yeh, Hiroshi Yoshimura, Coil, Factory Floor, Elysia Crampton, LA Timpa, Karenn, Kali Malone......\n\n...just to name a few, and the list could go on and on and ON !!!!\n\nLooking to meet in person over casual drinks at first, and then go from there!",

        "description": "<p>If the name of this group appealed to you then I doubt you need paragraph after paragraph describing what an introvert is. You know what the general perception of you is and that it tends to be far from the truth. <b>Exhibit A:</b> the first Google search result for \"definition of introvert\": noun: 1. a shy, reticent, and typically self-centered person. <i>Really</i>, Google?! You were doing OK until you described us as \"self-centered\"... <br> </p>\n<p>If you're on this site it's because you're looking to meet new people, and for introverts that can be a scary endeavor. I'll admit up front that I joined this site more than two years ago and I haven't attended an event yet. If this sounds like you let's change that together. My hope is that by clearly defining our age range and the types of activities we will be partaking in we will attract like-minded individuals who have common interests and passions, which will lead to meaningful connections. I also plan on mixing things up in an effort to not let the group get monotonous. Boston is a fun city which merits exploration in lieu of hanging out at the same coffee shop, bar, or bowling alley. A sampling of potential events: <br> </p>\n<p>\u2022 Restaurant meetups, with an emphasis on culinary offerings (I am a foodie) in a comfortable setting. Perhaps do them in a variety of series? (international, adventurous, seasonal, restaurant week, brunch, tapas, dessert) <br> </p>\n<p>\u2022 Bar/coffee shop meetups in small groups (4-6 people) in a laid back environment that is conducive to conversation</p>\n<p>\u2022 Wine tastings, brewery/distillery tours <br> </p>\n<p>\u2022 Movie meetups - more cerebral movies instead of blockbusters (indie/foreign/art house), with the occasional must-see 3D movie (Boston Common, Coolidge Corner, Kendall Square, Harvard Film Archive, Brattle Theatre, Somerville Theater) <br> </p>\n<p>\u2022 Concerts - more intimate venues/jazz clubs (MFA, The Sinclair, Paradise Rock Club, Brighton Music Hall, The Middle East, Cafe 939, Orpheum Theatre, Club Passim, Regattabar, Symphony Hall, Berklee Performance Center) instead of large, loud, crowded venues</p>\n<p>\u2022 Lectures (Harvard, MFA) <br> </p>\n<p>\u2022 Comedy shows (Wilbur Theatre, Laugh Boston) <br> </p>\n<p>\u2022 Sporty activities (snow tubing, ice skating, bowling, hiking) <br> </p>\n<p>\u2022 Sporting events (Red Sox, Celtics) <br> </p>\n<p>\u2022 Museum/aquarium outings <br> </p>\n<p>\u2022 you get the idea... <br> </p>\n<p><b>Please Note:</b> this group is meant for those between the ages of 20-39. Membership will be limited to those that fall within this age range. For those who fall outside that range I appreciate your interest but hope you will join and participate in other groups that are targeted at your demographics and interests. If you feel none exist I would suggest you create one.</p>\n<p><b>Code of Conduct:</b> I ask that you please be respectful to me, our other members, and the businesses/vendors we interact with (e.g. servers, business owners, etc.). Rudeness or behavior that makes other members uncomfortable will not be tolerated and you will be removed from the group. If you encounter such behavior please let me know as my goal is to preserve a comfortable and friendly environment. <br> </p>\n<p><b>New Members:</b> if you submit an incomplete profile or have a profile picture that isn't of you (nature, animal, etc) then your membership request will be declined</p>",

        "description": "<p>Hardware is dead. Long live hardware!</p>\n<p>There is no question that hardware has been white-hot these past few years. Exits such as Nest and Oculus Rift are just some of the more recent data points in why hardware is hot.</p>\n<p>There is plenty that we know about hardware. We know for instance that hardware is hard. We know that mass manufacturing is fraught with difficulty. We know that the proliferation of Adruinos and Raspberry Pis have lowered the barrier to hardware entry.</p>\n<p>We also know that not all hardware is the same. Certainly something like the Nest Thermostat is intrinsically different from something like the hoverboard, even though both are fundamentally made up of the same components, such as a processing unit, PCB board &amp; assembly, sensors, casing, etc.</p>\n<p>What is it about the Nest Thermostat, or even the Autonomous Car that sets it apart from the \"onesy\" pieces of hardware such as the hoverboards or \"dumb\" cars?</p>\n<p>The answer, IMHO, is the Connectivity and Intelligence that is built into one set of devices versus the other. A Connected and Intelligent device is more than just a piece of hardware -- it has the capacity to learn from its peer-device, change its behavior over time, and become integrated into- rather than just be added onto- a consumer's life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Connected &amp; Intelligent devices have requirements that extend those which we traditionally think of as being \"merely\" hardware. On top of everything from the traditional component selection, prototyping, manufacturing, etc., each of these devices now also has to contend with issues such as privacy, security, networking, authentication, etc.</p>\n<p>This difference, again IMHO, is what sets apart the Hardware 2.0 era of Smart Home, Smart City, and Smart AllSortsOfThings from their predecessors. The Boston Connected &amp; Intelligent Device Meetup is intended to be a platform for discussion, design, growth, and promotion of such devices.</p>",

We meet in small venues with limited seating, so we place low caps on RSVPs. For this reason, we enforce our RVSP policy. If you RSVP, you are expected to attend. Again, an RSVP of yes does not mean \"maybe\" or \"that looks cool.\" It means \"I will attend.\" Please observe our policy and only RSVP if you certainly will attend. Also please do not \"crash\" events if you did not make the list. If you repeatedly no-show or show up uninvited, you will be removed from the group, as inaccurate RSVP counts create hassles for our hosts and organizers.</p>\n<p>Why do we ask for a profile photo? Because we like to know who you are to help keep that \"lost Meetup look\" down to a minimum when you first show up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And yes, tea drinkers are kindly welcome to join the group.</p>",

Thanks to the confluence of top universities, hospitals, research institutes, large pharmaceutical companies, and a vibrant biotech startup community, Boston has arguably the strongest CBB community in the nation. However, for practitioners of computational biology in Boston the landscape can appear siloed and unapproachable, perhaps due in part to the lack of a centralized networking group. The Boston CBB Meetup hopes to fill this void and act as a regular venue for computational biologists in the Boston area to meet, network, share information, and learn.</p>",

We meet in small venues with limited seating, so we place low caps on RSVPs. For this reason, we enforce our RVSP policy. If you RSVP, you are expected to attend. Again, an RSVP of yes does not mean \"maybe\" or \"that looks cool.\" It means \"I will attend.\" Please observe our policy and only RSVP if you certainly will attend. Also please do not \"crash\" events if you did not make the list. If you repeatedly no-show or show up uninvited, you will be removed from the group, as inaccurate RSVP counts create hassles for our hosts and organizers.</p>\n<p>Why do we ask for a profile photo? Because we like to know who you are to help keep that \"lost Meetup look\" down to a minimum when you first show up.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And yes, tea drinkers are kindly welcome to join the group.</p>",

Thanks to the confluence of top universities, hospitals, research institutes, large pharmaceutical companies, and a vibrant biotech startup community, Boston has arguably the strongest CBB community in the nation. However, for practitioners of computational biology in Boston the landscape can appear siloed and unapproachable, perhaps due in part to the lack of a centralized networking group. The Boston CBB Meetup hopes to fill this void and act as a regular venue for computational biologists in the Boston area to meet, network, share information, and learn.</p>",

See below for payment details.** I'm offering a 90-day free trial period.\u00a0Unpaid members will automatically be removed by Meetup after 90 days.\u00a0 You can always rejoin afterward if you change your mind.\n* When paying for an event, please use **Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal. You can find me as Carol Portnoy, caroleena 40, caroleena40@gmail.com or 917-837-4504. Be sure to mark the transaction as \"friends and family or I'll be charged a fee as a retailer. Please also put in the comments your name as it appears on your profile, and what the payment is for.**\n* If you cannot attend an event **for which you purchased a ticket**, please advise me and I will offer the ticket to the waitlist. If someone wants it, they can reach out to you directly. You are also free to offer your purchased ticket to a friend or relative (just let me know!).\n* **If you are unable to attend any event you registered for, please change your RSVP at least 24 hours in advance to allow someone from the waitlist to attend, and for me to change any reservations without penalty.**\n* If you are a member who habitually registers and cancels within 24-48 hours or doesn't respond to my messages about an event, and there is a waitlist for an event with women who always show up, I reserve the right to move you to the waitlist in exchange for one of those regular attendees.\n* Of course, sometimes things happen on the day of an event, but unless you send me a message, you'll be marked as a No-Show. No-Shows are unfair to those on the waitlist, to restaurants, and to me. I do not get notifications from Meetup when an RSVP is changed. **My phone number is 917-837-4504. Please call or text with last-minute questions or cancellations.**\n* You will be removed from the group after two no-shows, or two last-minute cancellations (less than 24 hours) when there's a waitlist or reservation. Let's be respectful of each other!\n\n**MEETUP SETTINGS:**\n**Make sure you are receiving email notifications of new events, changes to events, cancellations of events, messages in Event Chat, etc.** If you don't have your settings on for these email notifications, you might miss important information unless you go to Meetup and look at our group page (which you should do often if you have an upcoming event).\n\n* Log into meetup.com. I believe you have to be on the website, not the app, to choose these settings. You can access the website on your phone via your browser.\n* Click the three horizontal lines or three dots in the upper left or right of the group page, or the down arrow next to your photo. These may be different on Apple vs. Android vs. laptop.\n* Select \"Settings.\"\n* On the left side of the page, select \"Email Updates.\" You can select any or all of the \"Updates from Meetup,\" which relate to the Meetup organization, not from any groups. You probably want to be notified when someone sends you a message, and of suggested events based on your interests (which you can select further down in the settings list).\n* Scroll down to \"Updates About Your Groups.\" I recommend you select at least the following:\n* New event announcements\n* My RSVP is confirmed\n* Changes to event time or location\n* New comments & chat messages\n* Event reminders\n* Event updates from organizers\n* Announcement to members about the group\n\nI welcome event feedback and ratings (visit the event page), and any tips on how I can improve our group!\n\nI look forward to some good times with you!\n\nCarol",

This is so that our event organizers can recognize you at our events. Thank you!</p><p>Welcome! This group is for those in Boston who like to play strategy (and slightly silly) games and be social at the same time. It is perhaps easiest to break this down word by word:</p><p>Strategy games: The gaming focus of this group will be on strategy games, games that make you think and plan ahead, such as Ticket to Ride, Great Western Trail, Alchemists, Terraforming Mars, Agricola, Through the Ages, and many more. Of course, we don't expect that you know how to play all these games; we will always welcome newcomers and will sometimes be learning these games ourselves for the first time.</p><p>Slightly silly games: Galaxy Trucker, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, and Space Alert are examples of \"slightly silly\" games. Do note that there's still strategy involved, but we certainly welcome games that make us laugh while we're playing!</p><p>Social: To be clear, this group will be as much about the gaming as the social interaction, which is why it's different from other such groups in Boston. But if you see the person next to you as simply someone to beat and nothing more, then this is not the group for you.</p><p>From the gaming groups we've been to (and run), there is a clear set of gamers in the Boston area who very much like these types of games, and who like the idea of possibly forming friendships with their fellow players, and that's who we're looking for! If you think you'd like this kind of interaction, sign up and come to one of our events. And if you have questions, don't hesitate to contact one of the organizers. See you soon!</p>",

Many of our members also attend conventions in and around New England and enjoy cosplaying. In addition to direct cultural events and activities, our group also goes on adventures together. We may go hiking, kayaking, to non-Japanese restaurants, to theme parks, etc... During these events, organizers and events host encourage and spark conversation that leads back to our love of the Japanese culture.</p>\n<p>Overall, <strong>The Boston Japanese Anime &amp; Film Social Group</strong> will introduce you people that are just as enthusiastic as you about Japanese culture.

All the events listed here are active RfR virtual events (identified as \"Network event\") or are meetings cross-posted from other local groups.*\n*We strive to serve as many areas as possible, but we do not have enough volunteers to handle them all. If you are interested in helping to host a meeting in your area, feel free to post a comment here in Meetup, or go to [recoveringfromreligion.org/volunteer](http://recoveringfromreligion.org/volunteer) to apply.*\n**What Recovering from Religion is about:**\nDoubt your beliefs? Have questions about changing or leaving your faith?\nYou are not alone, and we are here to help.\nLearning how to live after questions, doubts, and changing beliefs is a journey. We at Recovering from Religion are intimately familiar with this path and are here to help you to cross that bridge. Our passion is connecting others with support, resources, community, and most of all, hope.\nThe primary focus of a Recovering From Religion support group is to provide ongoing and personal support to individuals as they let go of their religious beliefs. This transitional period is an ongoing process that can result in a range of emotions, as well as a ripple effect of consequences throughout an individual\u2019s life. As such the support meetings are safe and anonymous places to express these doubts, fears, and experiences without biased feedback or proselytizing.\nWe are here to help each other through this journey.\nIf you find you need to talk with someone before the meeting date, RfR has a hotline and online chat for that express purpose. Call (844) 368-2848 to speak with someone or go to [www.recoveringfromreligion.org](http://www.recoveringfromreligion.org) to chat online.\nIf you\u2019re seeking professional help, we can offer the Secular Therapy Project to provide options to connect with a professional therapist. All therapists have been thoroughly vetted by our organization and offer only evidence-based and non-religious treatment. Connect with them at\u00a0[www.seculartherapy.org](https://www.seculartherapy.org).",

Come check one out!\n\nLesbian/Bi/Trans/Queer Speed Dating events are open to all lesbian, bisexual, nonbinary, and genderqueer folks. They are a trans-welcoming space, and intolerance will not be permitted. No cis-men, please.\n\n**How Speed Dating Works:**\n\nYou\u2019ll need a smartphone to share what type of matches you\u2019re interested in and for leaving your feedback. Our simple smartphone technology allows us to tailor the event to the age and \u201ctype\u201d of person you\u2019d like to meet. You tell us where your preferred date lies on the masculine-feminine spectrum, along with their age range. The algorithm determines the best matches possible, allowing for a more tailored experience than random, public speed dating.\n\nFor **Online Speed Dating** you\u2019ll meet your matches in intimate break-out rooms, so you\u2019ll need a separate device with the Zoom app. **In-Person events** are hosted at our favorite neighborhood bars and restaurants.\n\nAfter getting to know each other during five-minute rounds you\u2019ll use our matching technology to privately share whether you think they\u2019re second date material, a new friend, or a business connection. The next day you\u2019ll receive the contact info of anyone you matched with.\n\n***With Little Gay Book You Can Also\u2026***\n\n* **Join Our Lesbian Matchmaking database -**\n* [https://littlegaybook.com/create-a-profile-now/](https://littlegaybook.com/create-a-profile-now/)\n* **Level up your love life with our Single, Sexy & Queer Dating Program -** [https://littlegaybook.com/single-sexy-queer/](https://littlegaybook.com/single-sexy-queer/)\n* **Participate in a Curated Mini-Dates Event -**\n* [https://littlegaybook.com/curated-mini-dates/](https://littlegaybook.com/curated-mini-dates/)\n* **Get Dating & Relationship Coaching from Dr. Frankie -** [https://littlegaybook.com/coaching/](https://littlegaybook.com/coaching/)",

I am starting this group to create a group of writers who write either fiction or nonfiction- who are interested in getting together to help with writer's block, give constructive feed back on each other's writings and find creative ways to bring out ideas in each other for future writings. Writers of all levels welcome. My idea is to meet on one weekend day (Sundays) and one week day in the afternoons (am willing to hear which day works best for the group). I would love if we arranged times to see authors speak and read from their work as well. I would like this group to be supportive of each other's writing and positive as well.",

Spend the weekend at a guest house in New Hampshire with a small group of like-minded guys? Drive the Pacific Coast highway with some buddies? Go clubbing in Montreal with people that were strangers but are fast becoming your best friends?</p>\n<p>My idea with this group is to gather together and brainstorm ideas for travel. Maybe you'll just find one person that you can plan a trip with. Maybe we'll put together a small group of 10-15 people to do a cruise, or travel through France, or even hike the Appalachian trail. The possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>Once we have some members, I will plan a get together where we can figure out what our priorities are. You can meet people and see if someone shares your interest. If we have a lot of people with shared interest then we can plan a group trip somewhere. It doesn't have to be expensive....it could be as simple as camping at a local park.</p>\n<p>Sign up if you're interested. I would prefer if you posted a face pic so that we can get to know each other.</p>",

VortexHealing\u00ae Divine Energy Healing is not only a healing art, but a path for awakening. It is designed to transform the roots of emotional consciousness, heal the physical body, and awaken freedom within the human heart. This group\u2019s focus is to assist others interested in learning about VortexHealing\u00ae, and to offer healings using VortexHealing\u00ae Divine Energy. By receiving both individual and group healings by trained VortexHealers, you will be able to see more clearly into your issues and address them at a deeper level.**\n\u00a0\n**The view of VortexHealing\u00ae is that all of life in One (One Source, One Consciousness, One Divinity), expressing Itself as this amazing experience of creation. We experience Creation through our human form, which can create all kinds of issues and false identities that over time imprint or condition every level of our human system. This web of conditioning distorts our experience of being human, leading to potential issues/blockages in our human energy system, which can ultimately create weakness and physical disease, as well as countless forms of emotional suffering.**\n\u00a0\n**The intention of VortexHealing\u00ae is to release this conditioning on every level it is found, moving a person towards emotional balance and energetic strength. In addition, it helps to create enough inner space from personal conditioning, and enough self-awareness, for one to begin awakening out of our conditioned web of reality to the freedom and oneness that is our true nature.**\n\u00a0\n**\u00aeVortexHealing is a registered service mark of Ric Weinman.

We are here to be empathetic and extend a hand to those who feel isolated, struggle with the pressure to produce, find it hard to open up about their struggles because of stereotypes, live with distractions, stuck in situations that hinder healing, fear that they are not good enough, among others.**\n\nWe are here to break the notion that emotional/mental healing is expensive, time-consuming, and ineffective. We aim to inspire people that it is possible to break free from their old destructive patterns of toxicity and reactivity. We are here to transform our lives and the lives of others, one meetup event at a time.",

Our goal is to create an environment that's welcoming, fun, and educational.</p>\n<p>A paradox...</p>\n<ul> \n <p>The argument for open source (\"free\" as in speech) software is stronger than ever.</p> \n <p>GNU/Linux has been wildly successful in the server market.</p> \n <p>Desktop GNU/Linux operating systems like Ubuntu provide a rich end-user experience on par or better than commercial rivals in many respects.</p> \n</ul>\n<p>...Yet the uptake of using GNU/Linux as an end-user (desktop/laptop) operating system still lags. This Meetup aims to end that by:</p>\n<p>1. Creating a community of GNU/Linux on the desktop enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>2. Providing a venue where GNU/Linux questions can get asked by users of all levels.</p>\n<p>3. Fostering GNU/Linux on the desktop evangelism. Let's spread the word!</p>\n<p>We welcome long time GNU/Linux enthusiasts, those who've heard of GNU/Linux but aren't even sure what it is, and everyone in between. Join us!</p>\n<p><span><strong>We're part of <span>BLU</span>!</strong> <span>BLU</span> is the <strong>Boston Linux &amp; Unix User <span>Group</span></strong> and has been meeting actively since 1994.&nbsp; <span>BLU</span> does a fantastic job of covering topics across the broad spectrum of GNU/Linux, from technical topics to end-user topics.&nbsp; I'm excited that <span>BLU</span> has invited our <span>group</span> to become a <span>sub</span>- <span>group</span> of theirs.&nbsp; This gives us tremendous support from more experienced users and allows us to coordinate events.&nbsp; As a <span>sub</span>- <span>group</span>, we aim to focus on using GNU/Linux on the desktop and attracting new and less technical users to the platform.&nbsp; To learn more about <span>BLU</span>, please visit <a href=\"http://www.blu.org/\">http://www. <span>blu</span>.org</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>To learn more about our group, please visit <a href=\"http://LibreBoston.org\">http://LibreBoston.org</a>. <br></span></p>",

        "description": "<p>Boston: <br>Are you interested in building passive income &amp; net worth through real estate, but do not have the time to put your tool belt on and unclog toilets?</p> \n<p>Defining YOU: you're a busy professional, working for someone else or in your own business. You make good money, but have no or little time to invest it outside of retirement/ stocks. You're looking for alternative ways to invest your funds so that they can start generating returns for you. </p> \n<p>The primary focus will be to educate the group members on passive real estate investing. Apartment/ commercial investing is unlike most investments, you have to really get to know the people you want to partner up with or risk losing a lot of money. This is not some pitch, we have brought together some of the most active apartment investors in the area to give you a broad perspective on this asset class. Apartment building investing is a very unique investing class, some benefits including:</p> \n<p>-Cash flow during hold period <br>-Depreciation that can eliminate most taxes on said cash flow<br>-Payout upon sale of property in a few years</p> \n<p>This event is held at the private BC club with limited space, so please send me a message with your information in addition to RSVP, so I can add you to security list. Club rules, business attire required. </p> \n<p>P.S. this group is for large apartment buildings only, we will not be covering condos, 2 units, flipping, vendors, single family investment etc. </p> \n<p>Hope to see you soon!</p> \n<p>Tom <br>Exeter Equity Partners, LLC. <br>Thomas@exeterequitypartners.com</p>",

If you're new to meditation, come 10-15 minutes early so I can give you some suggestions. Bring a chair, cushion, or something to sit on so you can be relatively stable for 20-45 minutes. You are welcome to do your own form of meditation &amp; you're welcome to leave when you want. This group is the motivation for me and others to get up early &amp; meditate outside. After 30 years of indoor practice, I began meditating outdoors a few months ago &amp; love it! I will guide the first 5 minutes of each sitting and then we'll be with the sounds, smells, sensations, tastes of the outdoors.</p>",

Somos un grupo de hispanohablantes que se re\u00fane una vez al mes para comentar un libro en espa\u00f1ol, charlar y en general pasarlo bien (normalmente despu\u00e9s de la charla almorzamos en un restaurante de la zona). Leemos un poco de todo, desde Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez hasta Borges y por supuesto que estamos abiertos a vuestras sugerencias. Somos una mezcla de gente de muchos lugares (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Espa\u00f1a, Estados Unidos, Guatemala, Honduras, Italia, M\u00e9xico, Nicaragua, Panam\u00e1, Paraguay, Per\u00fa, Puerto Rico, la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, Rusia, Uruguay, Venezuela, etc.) as\u00ed que todos sean bienvenidos\u2026 Nos reunimos en un grupo normalmente de entre 15 y 25 personas. Si quieres saber m\u00e1s, no dudes en contactarnos. Esperamos verte pronto! Saludos, Mark",

Come check one out!\n\nLesbian/Bi/Trans Speed Dating events are open to all lesbian, bisexual, nonbinary, and genderqueer folks. They are a trans-welcoming space, and intolerance will not be permitted. No cis-men, please.\n\nOur Poly, Kinky, and Queer events are open to people of all genders and all sexualities.\n\n**How Speed Dating works:**\n\nYou\u2019ll need a smartphone to share what type of matches you\u2019re interested in and for leaving your feedback. Our simple smartphone technology allows us to tailor the event to the age and \u201ctype\u201d of person you\u2019d like to meet. You tell us where your preferred date lies on the masculine-feminine spectrum, along with their age range. The algorithm determines the best matches possible, allowing for a more tailored experience than random, public speed dating.\n\nFor **Online Speed Dating** you\u2019ll meet your matches in intimate break-out rooms, so you\u2019ll need a separate device with the Zoom app. **In-Person events** are hosted at our favorite neighborhood bars and restaurants.\n\nAfter getting to know each other during five-minute rounds you\u2019ll use our matching technology to privately share whether you think they\u2019re second date material, a new friend, or a business connection. The next day you\u2019ll receive the contact info of anyone you matched with.\n\n***With Little Gay Book You Can Also\u2026***\n\n* **Join Our Lesbian Matchmaking database -**\n* [https://littlegaybook.com/create-a-profile-now/](https://littlegaybook.com/create-a-profile-now/)\n* **Level up your love life with our Single, Sexy & Queer Dating Program -** [https://littlegaybook.com/single-sexy-queer/](https://littlegaybook.com/single-sexy-queer/)\n* **Participate in a Curated Mini-Dates Event -**\n* [https://littlegaybook.com/curated-mini-dates/](https://littlegaybook.com/curated-mini-dates/)\n* **Get Dating & Relationship Coaching from Dr. Frankie -** [https://littlegaybook.com/coaching/](https://littlegaybook.com/coaching/)",

        "description": "If you're a Foodie who enjoys dining out with likeminded people who happen to live on the Northshore (i.e. Revere, Lynn, Swampscott, Marblehead, Salem, Beverly, etc.) and/or around Boston....keep reading.\n\nAre you tired of getting restaurant recommendations from folks who put ketchup on their ketchup and/or scrambled eggs, who drown their sushi rice in soy sauce, who think of beef & broccoli as authentic Chinese food, who are troubled by veal or seeing the face of a whole fish, and/or who are afraid to try eating anything new?\n\nI used to have a dining club when I lived in New York City and was hoping to start another group now that I live in Revere.\n\nInitially, I'm just trying to determine if there are enough folks interested in trying fun and interesting restaurants, primarily on the Northshore and/or in Downtown Boston.\n\nMy expectation is to first get some folks engaged in on-line chatter, then have a few meet-n-greets with hors d'oeuvres at local pubs, but then having regularly scheduled events at a diversity of restaurants. For example, my NYC dining group met the first Wednesday of every month for a nearly a decade.\n\nBeing a food snob is not all about expensive high-end Michelin-starred places. One of the best things I ate in 2022 was a rice appetizer at a place subsequently nominated for a James Beard Award. One of the best things I've eaten in 2023 was a $10 bowl of eggs steamed with black truffles.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to make us all more informed Foodies. That does not mean we have to agree about every morsel, it means we have to agree to disagree. Like debating if Manet or Monet was the better painter - we've already established that we understand impressionistic painters. We can do the same thing with food.\n\nTake Notice: I find most alcohol is better after a good meal. I believe that if you have severe food allergies, this may not be a group for you. And while my politics are certainly left-of-center, all views are welcomed if they are well informed.\n\nFinally, and FWIW - I have no other on-line presence and this group is not being formed for any commercial purposes.\n\nP.S. My first name is Jonathan, but my friends have been calling me 'J.Z.' for a long time.",

        "description": "<p><b>Greetings !</b> <br> <b>Welcome to the photography meetup group for amateurs who want to discover the beauty of Boston and learn how to take better photos.</b></p>\n<p>This group offers actual classes and workshops designed to help you become a better photographer regardless of your current level or camera equipment. I am a professional photography instructor with 20 years of experience in designing and teaching workshops. I design fun, challenging learning activities for each session that build skills in creative seeing, camera navigation, and photographers way of being. Much of what I teach, I learned while working at Polaroid Corporation for 15 years. My ideas about creativity, beauty, and photography offer a fresh perspective on photography. &nbsp;I take your photography seriously, but we have fun along the way.</p>\n<p>Whether you have always called Boston home, or are just learning your way around, this photography group is a great way to discover the beauty of Boston. We are serious about having fun together. We will learn about Boston while honing our photography skills. And after class we always make time for socializing with food and drinks in the neighborhood we are exploring together.</p>\n<p>If you've ever wanted to learn how to take better photos, but you don't want to get bogged down with all the technical stuff, then you're going to love this. </p>\n<p>This meetup group is for you if:</p>\n<p>\u2022 <i>You own a camera (or smart phone with a camera) and you'd really like to use it more, but you're not really sure where to start and what to do.</i></p>\n<p><i>\u2022 You would like to explore different neighborhoods in Boston like Chinatown, The North End, and Beacon Hill.</i></p>\n<p><i>\u2022 You enjoy meeting likeminded people from different cultures who love photography.</i></p>\n<p><i>\u2022 Maybe you've taken a photography workshop before or tried picking up one of those thick, boring books, but you quickly got overwhelmed and overloaded with the technical stuff.</i></p>\n<p><i>\u2022 You don't intend on becoming a \"master photographer\", but you'd like to learn how to take better pictures of things you find interesting. That could be nature, people, landscape, architecture, etc. Whatever you feel drawn to.</i></p>\n<p><span>And the best part? The techniques you'll learn will have an immediate impact on your photography. You'll see an instant improvement and you'll also have an opportunity to get positive and constructive feedback for your work in a supportive environment.</span> <br> </p>\n<p>If that sounds good to you, then I invite you to join our group. You'll learn a lot, meet some warm and wonderful people, and have lots of fun while you improve your photography, your English, and your knowledge of Boston. I'm looking forward to meeting you in person soon.</p>\n<p>You can get started learning some of the practices by exploring my award winning book.</p>\n<p>Flow-tography Take Better Pictures.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/flow-tography-better-photos/id499049037?mt=11&amp;uo=4\" class=\"linkified\">http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/flow-tography-better-phot...</a></p>",

We can discuss our experiences with getting great food, and about our favorite alcoholic beverages. </p> \n<p>Discussions do not have to be limited to these topics either, this will be an open forum for people to share anything they feel like about themselves.</p> \n<p>We\u2019ll be hosting zoom meetings every 1-2 weeks. If more than 3 people join, we can start splitting people up into breakout sessions, and rotate between groups so everybody has a chance to have a good conversation with everyone else in the group. Suggestions are also welcome.</p> \n<p>Once things start to open up, we\u2019ll also be open to hosting some group outings to some restaurants and bars where we can interact in person, but for now we will keep the meetings virtual so everyone can stay safe!</p>",

But, I'm not the most savvy person when it comes to putting together a profile and so I thought I would turn to meetup for some help.\n\nI have a professional camera and a NetFlix approved video camera - and know how to use both of them. I'm also pretty handy with Photoshop and Premier. What I thought we could do is get together, exchange a few stories about our trials and tribulations, and then help each other with our profiles. I think it will be fun.\n\nFor the photography, I thought we could set up some of shots in Annie Leibovitz fashion... I'm sure you all know her work. Otherwise Google her. She's fantastic. Hope you will join. Thanks, Joe",

        "description": "<p>Hey all, this group is for people that are new to the awesome city of Boston (or surrounding areas)! Since this group was formed early last summer we've done a little bit of everything: going out to dinners, grabbing drinks, visiting museums, brewery tours, ice skating, going to comedy shows, bowling, and exploring specific areas of the city.</p>\n<p>Our crowd is usually half regulars, half newcomers so don't be shy if you've never done meetup before! Organizers make sure there are always a lot of fun events planned. Members can also create and organize events, or they can suggest ideas to the organizers (note: We don't allow our group to be used simply as a platform for fundraisers. If any of our regular members is involved in a fundraiser, we're happy to support them, but please do not join our group for this purpose alone)</p>\n<p>Answers to some FAQs about the group:</p>\n<p>-The target age for the group is roughly 22 to 36. No one will check your age of course but if you're way out of this range it'll be a little obvious :) We'd really like to keep the group at least in the 20s and 30s.</p>\n<p>-Member Photos: It is required that all members have a satisfactory photo that we can use to identify members at events. This helps us a great deal as well as aids other members in recognizing you. Please make sure your photo is of YOU and not a pet/landscape/cartoon, as it'll be easier for us to spot you at events</p>\n<p>-It doesn't cost any money to be a member! Many of the events cost money (food, drinks, admission, etc.) which is why you can pick and choose which ones you attend. Some of our events are spendy, and some are free! Keep in mind that the organizers do have to pay dues to run this group. If you have a good time and can donate a buck or two, please do. It goes a long way to help cover the costs of running the meetup.</p>\n<p>-If you've RSVP'd \"Yes\" to an event but decide not to go, please change your RSVP to \"No\" as soon as you can. Organizers plan around the number they're expecting and it's respectful not to make them wait for people who aren't coming.</p>\n<p>Any other questions? Just message the organizers!</p>",

Lately we've been playing at Old South Church in Copley Square, which is great because they have music stands, a piano, and the place looks and sounds beautiful.\n\nAnyone can come and play. No audition and no long-term commitment is required. It's free to join and free to play.\n\nThe music we choose can be played by almost any group of instruments. We've played Arioso, Air on the G String, Brandenburg Concerto No. 3, Little Fugue in G minor, chorales, and more. You can download your parts beforehand to practice or to print out and bring to the Bach Break.\n\nWhenever we have to pay to rent a space to play in, we ask for a voluntary contribution to offset the rental cost. Usually, folks give about $10 each.\n\nYou can find more information at [http://www.SymphonicLaboratory.com/bachbreak](http://www.SymphonicLaboratory.com/bachbreak) \\- where you can also download parts to print for the next upcoming Bach Break\\.\n\n**Who does this?**\u00a0\nPeople come from down the block and from three towns away. Students, tech workers, baristas, retirees ... we all love Bach and the stress-free, beautiful experience of taking time to enjoy playing his music with friendly and supportive folks.",

        "description": "**ATTENTION: Nudity is not an invitation! Naked in Motion has a strict no-cruising policy. If you receive any unwanted messages from someone from our group, please let us know immediately so we can take the appropriate actions. Your privacy will be respected, and your comfort and safety are our priority. Please do not respond to senders of unwanted messages.**\n\n**Naked in Motion** offers Naked! Yoga and Pilates classes online as well as in **Seattle** and **Boston** and **New York City** to promote body-positivity and offer participants a unique experience of freedom. *This meetup is specifically for our Boston classes and events.* We hope to resume our Boston classes soon, please subscribe to our newsletter for updates!\n\nWe aim to provide safer, inclusive spaces where people can take a collective journey through fear towards self-discovery and empowerment. We\u2019re starting a Naked! movement that challenges the status quo and enforces consent culture and feminist values. We\u2019re challenging a society that views nakedness as shameful; media that celebrates only certain kinds of bodies; and a patriarchal culture that values whiteness, cisnormativity, and heteronormativity. We\u2019re even redefining \u201cnudity\u201d by giving women and trans folk the option to wear bottoms in the name of equity (see our website for details). This isn\u2019t your average nudist club; it\u2019s a rebellious way of moving in the spirit of personal and social change.\n\n**Join the movement.**\n\n**Your body, just as it is right now, is awesome and deserves care and love.** Not the body you used to have or the one you hope to achieve, but the one you\u2019re in right this moment. And if you are trying to change parts of your body, that\u2019s okay too, but we think that change will happen most effectively with an attitude of self-compassion, rather than the typical self-judgement we often adopt when trying to meet \u201cfitness goals\u201d in this modern age of exercise fanaticism.\n\nIt is our hope that people will find our classes to be liberating experiences where they can shed their clothes, their worries about what they should look like, and the criticisms they face daily and open up their mind to the possibility of self-acceptance. We keep the lights on, literally, to encourage people to observe the body they brought with them to class, accept what they\u2019re working with, and learn to love and appreciate it for all the ways in which it supports them.\n\nNOTE: The RSVP's on Fetlife, Facebook & Meetup DO NOT reflect actual attendance. Most folks just come to class buying the ticket directly (link below) without bothering to RSVP online. To respect your privacy, you are not required to RSVP on any online or social platform. If you have any questions about the class, such as questions about the overall experience, gender ratio, or number of people who attend, [please see our FAQ page on our website.](http://www.nakedinmotion.com/faq/)\n\n**Please read our (updated) Community Rules:**\n\n**Everyone MUST be an active, willing participant and at least 18 years old.**\n\n**Naked! =** Nudity is mandatory. We make accommodations for accessibility. For example, we recognize that people need different tools for managing menstruation. Having your period doesn\u2019t necessitate wearing bottoms though; it\u2019s okay if your tampon string shows or you leak on your mat. Participants may opt to use items such as binders, bottoms, or prosthetics to manage trauma or gender dysphoria. These examples are not an exhaustive list, so if you need accommodation, just talk to us.\n\nOur goal in being *Naked!* is to practice self-compassion and body acceptance, which requires experiencing bodies as they are, and this can be challenging for many people. The purpose of accommodations is not to avoid this challenge but to remove obstacles that prevent engaging with it.\n\nOur approach aims to lower barriers to participation for those whose everyday lives make it understandably more difficult to attend a nude event. Upholding our rules creates safer spaces both in and out of class, and we value everyone\u2019s cooperation.\n\n**Consent:** All physical contact must be consensual. We\u2019ll provide a system for silently opting-out of adjustments during class. If you opt-in to adjustments, the instructor will ask for verbal consent before offering touch assistance. Know your boundaries! You can change your mind at any time, and anything less than an enthusiastic \u201cyes\u201d means \u201cno.\u201d Our consent policy applies to all situations, including physical contact that may seem appropriate in a clothed setting (e.g. hugs, moving through a crowd), so ask for permission before touching anyone before, during, and after class, even while clothed.\n\n**No Cruising:** Please maintain the desexualized atmosphere of our classes. Nudity is not an invitation for personal advances. Don\u2019t ask to meet up with people outside of class or make personal invitations to other events. If you'd like to publicize other events aligned with the NiM mission, speak to Willow directly. Also, please do not make comments about anyone\u2019s body or appearance, including compliments that may seem benign (e.g. \u201cyour hair looks nice\u201d). We\u2019ll prioritize the experience of the recipient over the intention of a compliment, so err on the side of caution! This applies to live events and online platforms (e.g. Meetup, Patreon).\n\n**Be Respectful:** We welcome all adults who abide by our rules and treat others with respect and kindness. Body-shaming or hateful comments of any kind will not be tolerated. Be aware of your gaze: it\u2019s okay to look around if you get lost during the movement, but take care not to stare or focus intently on others.\n\n**Cell Phones:** Cell phones are strictly prohibited while clothes are off, so please turn them OFF until the last person is clothed.\n\n**The Erection Question:** Signs of arousal such as erections can be involuntary and not necessarily sexually inspired. If you have an erection during the movement, just ignore it, or take a resting pose if you prefer. If you exhibit signs of arousal while socializing after class, please put on clothing for the comfort of other participants. Any activities described as illicit, obscene, or sexual in nature are illegal and not permitted in our classes.\n\n**No Latecomers:** Everyone is expected to be on time to hear the rules (even if you've heard them before). The instructor will close the entrance and place a sign on the door at the start of class. After this point, no further entry will be permitted, NO EXCEPTIONS, and we don't refund latecomers. Please DO NOT KNOCK or disrupt class in an attempt to gain late entry.\n\n**No Lingering:** Following the conclusion of class, please exit the premises in a reasonable amount of time as directed by the instructor. Do not wait to be alone with an instructor or student after class.\n\n**Be Sober:** Sobriety is mandatory. If you exhibit signs of intoxication, we may ask you to leave.\n\n**Responsible Use of Props:** We strongly encourage you to bring your own mat and towel, but some of our studios have mats available to rent. If you rent a mat, YOU MUST BRING A TOWEL. Please do not let communal mats, props, or straps come into contact with your genitals. Be mindful: don\u2019t sit on studio props, and put blankets or bolsters under your mat.\n\n**If you experience or witness a rule violation, please notify your teacher ASAP to help us identify people involved; you will remain anonymous. While we prefer to be notified in person, you can also email us at info@nakedinmotion.com. The instructor reserves the right to ask anyone to leave, and Naked in Motion management reserves the right to revoke further class privileges.**\n\n**Want to support the Naked! mission?

BANG was established back in September of 1986 when a few friends decided to stage a \"dinner in the buff.\" Since that time, the group has grown to over 500 members, and regularly holds nude gatherings in private homes, exclusively-rented facilities, and public areas commonly used for nude recreation. Both day and evening events are popular as well as weekend getaways.\n\nOur typical activities include house parties and potluck suppers (mostly indoors, but also outdoors if the Host has a private space & weather permits). In the Summer, there are visits to nude beaches and swimming holes, and nude camping and hiking. There are also visits to area nudist camps, and joint activities with other Gay/Bi Men's naturist clubs both locally and nationwide. All of which culminate each Summer at the GNI and IMEN Gatherings.\n\n**WE'RE LOOKING FOR EVENT HOSTS AND ORGANIZERS!** We're about naked social events such as pot luck dinners, book club nights, game nights, movie nights, massage nights, Wine Tastings, etc.\n\nWe are looking for new ideas, venues and people interested in helping out. Send us a message at bangma.org@gmail.com or through Meetup Messages with what type of event you would like to see or what type of event you would be willing to help on. Include a brief description of the event and if possible the venue. **If you host an event at your home, you receive $10 per paying guest** (to cover reasonable expenses such as paper plates, plastic cups, plastic utensils and paper napkins.)",

        "description": "<p><b>Tantra: The Art of Conscious Loving\u2122</b></p> \n<p>Come discover the power of Tantra as a healing art designed to awaken you to the pleasures of life. Learn to live your life by the principles of Tantra Yoga. At each moment you can experience love and oneness with all things. Tantra is a lifestyle. You can call it a mindfulness practice or you can call it the practice of bringing the Divine into everyday experiences from the most mundane moments to the peaks of ecstasy, the path of Tantra allows you to bring body, mind and spirit into balance.</p> \n<p>Have you ever wondered if there must be more to sexual loving? Have you experienced the kind of deep sexual connection with a partner that leads you to tears of joy and a deep sense of knowing the divine? Join this meet-up and learn that sex is an art form that every conscious person can master. Learn that when passion, love and consciousness join together they transform sex into a profound and loving meditation that increases intimacy, joy and connection.</p> \n<p>If you ever heard the word Tantra and wondered what all the fuss was about - then this is the meet-up for you. Come be informed and guided by three extremely experienced and knowledgeable teachers/healers, trained among others at the Source School of Tantra Yoga in Santa Cruz, CA, and participate in the inquiry of how to live life to its fullest. Say \"Yes, I want to live my life with passion and awareness!\" Studying Tantra will fulfill this promise by giving you priceless skills - not only in your intimate relationships but woven into all aspects of your life. Let's be students together! (<b>The word student comes from the Latin word studere which means to devote oneself.</b>)</p> \n<p>Although there has been a recent explosion of information on how to be more respectful and accepting of sexuality we can still struggle with the old cultural mixed messages that we carry within ourselves. In a safe and light-hearted environment we will explore these and continue to find ways to shed the old and bring in the new which is actually rooted in a deep knowing since the beginning of human consciousness.</p> \n<p>This meet-up group is geared towards beginners, but participants of all levels are welcome, you must be older than 18 years old. It is our experience that each time, no matter how often one has heard something, a new light is shone on an aspect that one thought (s)he had mastered. If you are a therapist/healer this meet-up group will also teach you practical tools that you can pass on to the people you work with. Together we will explore the basics of Tantra and move more deeply into the skills for deepening intimacy with yourself and/or a partner through meditation techniques, understanding and mastering energy, conscious communication, modalities of touch, and so much more. Classes will be a mix of didactic and experiential. We will have exercises, discussions, time for questions and answers, and sacred rituals (pujas).</p> \n<p>We meet once a month for a series of five. The first series of five began on January 15, 2012 and culminated on <b>May 23, 2012 with a Puja ritual</b> and a <b>Q &amp; A session with Charles Muir</b>, the author of <b>\"Tantra: the Art of Conscious Loving\"</b> followed by the <b>Beginner's Workshop on May25, 26 &amp; 27, 2012</b> when he was joined by <b>Leah Alchin</b>. Each workshop can be taken individually and will also build on concepts and practices of the previous ones. <b>The next five months' series began in the fall of 2012.</b></p> \n<p>In 2013 we sponsored <b>Sheri Winston, author of \"Women's Anatomy of Arousal\". The annual Source School of Tantra Yoga Beginner's Workshop will be held In June, 2018. Brynn Bishop and Wanda Santos are Elite Certified Tantra Educators with the Source School of Tantra Yoga. The curriculum is greatly informed by SSTY. However, they both draw on their considerable experience as Body-Psycho therapists with methods such as Internal Family Systems; Hypnosis; Rubenfeld Synergy Method; Trauma Work; Tai Chi; Chi Gung; EMDR; Holistic Neurology Energy Healing; Mind Power meditations; REIKI; Energy Practices and many others.</b></p> \n<p><b>We look forward to meeting you all and be students of Tantra together</b></p>",

Each group will separately perform songs from the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian cultures, respectively, and then join together to perform music that transcends the collective cultures. The idea of shared values, especially in these turbulent times, rises above our many cultures and connects us. By using music to explore the themes of freedom, we seek to create a culture of understanding, faith, and hope.</p>",

There will be some folks in the discussion who know quite a bit about dance and some that are new to it.&nbsp; I'm organizing this group to help develop a more engaged, informed audience for dance in the greater Boston area, under the auspices of Boston Dance Alliance, a nonprofit service organization.</p>",

Many artists struggle to find affordable space to showcase their work, while small businesses lack the foot traffic they need to thrive. NOSA is solving this problem by providing a platform for artists and small businesses to come together, engage with the public, and boost the local economy.\n\n**WHY NOSA?**\nWhat sets NOSA apart is our focus on community and collaboration. We believe that art is not just something to be consumed, but a powerful tool for bringing people together, fostering creativity, and building social capital. We also offer a unique blend of art and commerce, providing a platform for artists and small businesses to connect with each other and with the public. Through our events and initiatives, we are creating a dynamic and inclusive art ecosystem that benefits everyone involved.\n\n**JOIN THE NOSA COMMUNITY**\nWe invite you to join the NOSA community and help us build a more vibrant, inclusive, and creative Boston. Whether you're an artist looking to showcase your work, a small business owner looking to connect with new customers, or a supporter of the arts and community, there are many ways to get involved. Visit our website, follow us on social media, or attend one of our events to learn more about how you can be a part of this exciting initiative.",

Join us and together we can change this. Featured on BBC The Social and Boston's Rainbow Times. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>Welcome to the Time for Love Project! We create safe spaces for LGBTQ+ couples to hold hands in public. Our goal by holding hands in public is to create safety in numbers for ourselves and every LGBTQ+ couple who sees us. Join us and we'll be on our way to normalizing PDA for LGBTQ+ couples in Boston and beyond.</p>\n<p>If you're currently single, come by yourself or bring a friend to hold hands with! LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning+), allies, couples, singles, all ages - all are welcome. (per Meetup rules, anyone under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult) &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>Links for more info about us:</p>\n<p>\u2b50\ufe0f <a href=\"https://www.timeforloveproject.com\">https://www.timeforloveproject.com</a></p>\n<p>\u2b50\ufe0f <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p071wtrp\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p071wtrp</a></p>\n<p>\u2b50\ufe0f <a href=\"https://www.therainbowtimesmass.com/lgbtq-couples-fears-of-pdas-its-all-about-time-for-love-boston/\">https://www.therainbowtimesmass.com/lgbtq-couples-fears-of-pdas-its-all-about-time-for-love-boston/</a></p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p><i>\"If you are not personally free to be yourself in that most important of all human activities\u2026 the expression of love\u2026 then life itself loses its meaning.\" \u2013 Harvey Milk </i> <i>\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\udc6c\u270a</i></p>\n<p><i>*<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/dominicholden/most-lgbtq-americans-fear-violence-holding-hands\">source:</a> </i></p>\n<p><i> &lt;br&gt;</i></p>\n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p>",

If you want to get to know some folks and explore some wonderful paths, this group's for you!\n\nOur walks are 1.5 - 2hrs at a moderate pace, with gentle climbs to an elevation of 200 - 240 feet. (The Arboretum has three scenic hills.) We explore a different path every week.

As the future of the LGBTQ+ community, we know we need to carry and continue the fight for LGBTQ+ justice and equity. And this is the place to meet other people like you: people who want to make an impact, people who want to ensure that everyone in the LGBTQ+ community has the rights they deserve, and people who want to have fun while we\u2019re at it.\n\nWhat\u2019s coming up?\nGLAD Forward has plenty of opportunities just for young folks who live or work in Greater Boston. We\u2019re also your gateway to attend other GLAD events as a group. Never been to a GLAD event? Don\u2019t know anyone yet? Don\u2019t worry \u2013 you\u2019re already among friends.\n\nQuestions? Have ideas for events? Want to get involved?

        "description": "Welcome!\u00a0 Boston Countryside Cruisers (BCC), started in 2013, is a group for riders of most two- and three-wheeled motorcycles.\n\nOur group\u2019s mission is to enjoy motorcycling the backcountry roads of New England at a leisurely pace, in a fun and relaxed social atmosphere and in a safe manner.\u00a0\u00a0Our members, who typically reside around metro Boston, come from all walks of life, but all share the same love of cruising the countryside by bike. On ride days, we leave our problems behind to enjoy no-drama riding and making new (or renewing old) connections.\u00a0 Rides typically start from a variety of locations along or between Routes 128 and 495. Then we head out for half or full-day rides, traveling on quiet and beautiful country roads.\u00a0We sometimes host multi-day rides.\n\nAll BCC event organizers, ride leaders and sweeps are unpaid volunteers.\n\nCheck out upcoming and past rides on the Events tab of this Meetup site.\u00a0 You can also visit our group\u2019s [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BoCoCruisers) to see more about BCC people and events.\u00a0 The \u201cFiles\u201d section on Facebook contains recent group newsletters.\n\n## **Our Guiding Principles \u2026\u2026.**\n\nAll Boston Countryside Cruisers rides will:\n\\- Be open to all two\\- or three\\-wheeled motorcycles that can safely ride at and maintain highway speeds\\. \\(We\u2019ll occasionally need to ride short highway segments for expediency in getting from Point A to B\\)\\.\n\\- Be thoughtfully planned\\.\n\\- BE DRUG and ALCOHOL FREE\\.\n-Typically have 8-14 riders.\n\\- Stay within 10 mph of the speed limit nearly all of the time\\. \u00a0 \\(If you have the need for speed\\, this may not be the group for you\\)\\.\n\\- Choose back roads over highways whenever possible\\.\n\\- Be a relaxed and fun way to meet other riders\\.\n\n## **What to Expect on A Typical Ride\u2026**\n\nOur rides are well planned.\u00a0 You\u2019ll have a good idea, before you RSVP for a ride, about the route, mileage and riding time, the stops and where/when the ride will end. A posted ride will usually have a route map and a list of planned stops.\u00a0We plan rest stops every 60-90 minutes at facilities with bathrooms and fuel (such as newer Cumberland Farms or Alltowns) . Rides\u00a0often include a casual meal, ice cream, etc. along the way (generally avoiding chain restaurants.)\n\nRides typically avoid highways, but if we plan to use one you will know before signing up for a ride and we'll keep the highway travel to a minimum. All members and their bikes must be capable of safely riding at highway speeds.\n\n## **We\u2019re Also About Safety\u2026**\n\nWhile we want to hold fun events, our core principle\u00a0 is that everyone must be able to ride safely. \u00a0 BCC requires a minimum of one-year or 2,000 miles of riding experience, and an understanding of good practices for riding in a group of motorcycles.\u00a0Many of these practices are discussed in this 10-minute [video on group riding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erpkyD7SMfw) skills from the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.\u00a0\u00a0 Each rider must also be able to understand, act on, and pass along [group safety hand signals](https://www.msf-usa.org/downloads/Group_Ride.pdf).\n\nRide leaders conduct a safety briefing before each ride, including a review of commonly used hand signals.\n\nBottom line - to ride with BCC, you must be comfortable with, and have the riding skills necessary, to safely ride in a staggered motorcycle formation.\u00a0 This requires maintaining a 2-second gap between you and the bike in front of you, without drifting sideways in your lane or lagging behind.\n\n## **Joining BCC\u2026\u2026\u2026**\n\nBoston Countryside Cruisers is free to join for a 30-day trial period.\u00a0 If you wish to stay in the group after that, you will be asked to pay the $5 annual member dues (which BCC largely uses to pay Meetup for use of its website).\u00a0 All members and passengers must also complete our on-line Annual Liability Waiver and Emergency Contacts Form before taking your first ride with us. [Here\u2019s this year's form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bJN38zIaxKBdefreHNqt-WgT2EilGe38gu098nyQ2bg/edit?ts=65e346ff).\n\n**Come Out and Ride with Us!**",

We are not a business or dating group. The group is for sharing experiences and supporting each other in this difficult time.</p><p>This group has been in existence for a number of years on Boston's North Shore, however, our members come from all over New England. The group is very unique in that members have diverse backgrounds. This includes a wide range of professions, trades, economic and religious backgrounds. Over time, feedback from the people that join our group has been that they find comfort in meeting others who know what the divorce/separated experience is all about. </p><p>At each meeting, the group is facilitated by nonprofessionals. It is important that you know that we are simply a group of concerned people helping people. The comfort that you will find in this group has helped hundreds of people over the years and is a testimony to the longevity of the group. The comment is often made that people wish they had found this group sooner.</p><p>You be the judge...we invite you to attend our next meeting. The meetings start at 7:00 p.m. on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of every month. Everyone that attends our meetings, understands what is said in the meeting, stays in the meeting. Confidentiality is respected and you are encouraged to speak on your own terms and when you are ready. Meetings generally last approximately two hours.</p><p>Tremendous bonds of friendship have been forged and continue beyond the scope of the group. There are social opportunities that take place in addition to our support meetings, if you choose to participate. Several members who at one time were going through the divorce process continue to stay active in the group because they feel that they have something to share with others who are going through this phase in their life. We hope you will join us.</p>",

        "description": "We are a group of friends with similar interests - the primary one being hiking. It doesn't matter if it's a one-day trip or a multi-day backpack; we like climbing up and down mountains throughout the Northeast (and beyond). Having other people come along with us makes things even more fun. Other activities on our calendar include biking (rail trail, road, & off-road), kayaking (rivers, lakes, & ocean), skiing (downhill & cross country), and various adventure races.\nOur approach is simple - the strength of a cohesive group is greater than the sum of its individual parts. We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker. We travel in small groups (10-15 people) to lessen our impact on the environment and the others who are also out there enjoying the peace and solitude of the outdoors. The ultimate goal is to get outside, have a safe and enjoyable time, and then do it again.\nMost of our hikes involve climbing to the highest summits in the Northeast. That means people may have to get up early, drive a long distance, and then spend most of the day hiking. There aren\u2019t many late starts, short days, or easy/moderate level hikes on our calendar. Instead of trying to do something that another group has already perfected, we have partnered with the **[Blue Hills Hiking Club](http://www.meetup.com/Blue-Hills-Hiking)** out of Boston, MA. If you live in the Boston area and want to get outdoors they offer almost daily hikes of varying distances and speeds. \\\n\n\nIf this sounds like fun then be sure to join our group and sign-up for an event. \\",

We'll keep things casual in the beginning, and decide together how to best move forward as a group. (As of now, this Meetup is a grassroots effort, not affiliated with the official campaign.) All are welcome! We only ask that because of the personal nature of political discussion that everyone in the group is respectful of one another.

We often talk about how helpful it is to network with lawyers in similar positions, because so often our strengths are complementary (for example, I\u2019m a transactional tax lawyer, which many small firms don\u2019t have - and we don\u2019t have anyone experienced with ERISA). Any lawyer in a small or solo practice is welcome to join, or anyone considering this kind of move. We will develop together to meet members\u2019 needs - hopefully at least a monthly get-together (drinks, food, helpful talk) and an email list for sharing questions/problems and potential referrals. Free group, although you\u2019ll have to pick up your own drinks tab at events (unless a mysterious benevolent sponsor sweeps in).",

Now get out and enjoy some Social Fun.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>NOTE: This is NOT a dating group</span></strong><span>,</span> <span>about 90% of the members are Single that is not the group's focus. We're about making friends that can lead to dating . Over&nbsp;</span><span>100 Members that have gotten married. This is directly attributed to the relaxed, no pressure non dating group setting we've created.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Costs:</span></strong> <span>To join the group and attend most events is <strong>basically FREE</strong>, BUT we ask if you enjoyed the group, help us keep it going by making a $11 annual donation to help cover the costs associated with running such a large group like paying</span> <span>off the Meetup fees of $180/year.</span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>ALL Members</strong></span> are required to have a <span><strong>recent real clear main profile photo</strong></span> of themselves or they will not be allowed to join this group or removed for lacking this photo.

Arrive on time and never \"No Show.\" Members who \"No Show\" take away RSVP slots from other Members and negatively impact Social Fun events.</span></p>\n<p><span>5. <strong>Understand that after 3 'No Shows' over 3 months any Organizer CAN remove you from Social Fun</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>6. You are the ONLY ones capable of changing your Meetup Announcement e-mail settings. Social Fun Organizers cannot set these.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>7.

We're a social group for Third/Fourth Culture Adults in Boston. We hope to create a nice environment to interact, share our worldly experiences and make new friends. We plan to have a variety of activities, such as trying a variety of food, bar-hopping, language-learning events, or simply just having a cool meet-and-greet over coffee.\n\nThis article gives a decent description about third culture kids (or Adults):\nhttps://medium.com/a-culturated/10-ways-you-know-that-youre-a-third-culture-kid-73e916d26659",

Though it's origins are firmly footed in the Beats (highlights over the years have included Gregory Corso, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, and local figure John Wieners), the weekly gathering has included all styles of poetry at one time or another. Stone Soup Poetry met from 8-10 p.m. every Monday at the Out of The Blue Art Gallery, now at its new location at 541 Massachusetts Avenue in Central Square Cambridge, Massachusetts with an open mike sign-up at 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>This virtual new version of the group where the \"stone\" has been changed to \"sustenance\" will focus for the present on sharing writing in various poetic forms, writing from exercises used by poets who teach, and fostering community between poets and writers of songs.</p>",

We're working around the clock to find social activities with a maximum value of quirkiness and friendship. Don't go on another boring trip to that tourist trap or that axe throwing bar that everyone's heard about, again!\n\nAs a professional yoga and meditation instructor, I can\u2019t wait to share my journey of helping people find inner peace in fun and unique ways. We aim to create a community where everyone feels welcome and can find new friends sharing the same passion for quirky adventures.\n\nThe kinds of people who will enjoy our social events are curious & passionate, look for authenticity in others, find themselves active in the Boston area social scene, and looking to laugh most days of the week, even if they have to make up national holidays themselves.\n\nShow up to life!\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nThis group is proudly part of Peace Out Ski + Wellness Club, a high-energy mindfulness and skiing club. We host unique yoga and meditation parties in the Boston area.\n\nStill reading? Here\u2019s a reflective prompt: What would the bar or restaurant of your dreams look like? What would be on the menu? What would it smell like? What kind of furniture would you have? What would it feel like walking in? Share your ideas with the group and let's create our dream spots together!\n\n========\n\n**FB group: Looking for ways to stay connected w/fun people in their 30s and 40s who value mindfulness and being active?**\n\nI just made a brand new private Peace Out 30s and 40s mindfulness Facebook group - where you can connect with like-minded new friends! I'll be posting motivational quotes, fun themed costumes and mindfulness stuff, plus our upcoming yoga/meditation classes there :) Check it out here - [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1045183780505725](http://clicks.meetup.com/ls/click?upn=u001.NY3oBFzZ5LJDG7YcnfSAKu-2FXfTGw-2FvPXD7PPRLlSXtchIrY2eHTenBALLFxscd1-2FMAMGwI-2BGI8xvsNw7UlHQRg-3D-3D5uSm_xdUTvUhIjWlSJgufBblll4-2FcuaVca123SZLk5EUYKf9BYU9plMczE-2BisCz8YQYpOJfQ9riIO9e56TijOxQDg04vfiYN9xUOc7g0etBs7ii-2FyMU9mf4D6uu3MnBu-2FsLkXEmGB75xZFUznmlRSCzU1InogPiejiCkIePSLzKZBzY0TBzeocrMrb9faqUaJ2rhWxk9fNjYSurbC-2FK0vjKcQ0Oox3yKpezEyG-2FyC0T9c5C-2F-2FMU861IHbFinNIJ5ioLwp9VA0R-2Bt81FY5glQ1QXNZFxwYqnvCDlI1JP5-2BT3lMjcU0PmY3JvqU-2Fa5aa8wIFDNVRJZ6Z8QOVkZ1xT3ytAFyVw7TbHMZWWkq3oahT36oJhptFzAudXrURipAe0x7EoPFlfsiCV6UOX3GiZe2CyZkuwkYTNH4HcgAc-2BzQ4azNRcd9y0E7kXgzwbH-2Bf9iPZQFcab-2FsUzVlrROzoyc9-2BA0zBE23KKRqRCUFxlDAl9AtkjwLk4JJGeWWlTMP-2BQMOOgvuGs5sRtpcbaucq9RNKflwNwxOyt7WL-2BATlEW64z2iZP8tg033AeyOV1-2Bw0SQB21oXjskAx-2F9Ee1clOtCCO1gJV6JFdmD6hvGlozTO2nYcYTd1lMEVPU3kRGLZFbe-2BDwanimXlUfEgUgf2w69kciDXynwoXXu4TCNz5DU-2B8yDB0o4SdmTzKxNbh-2FzGnqfj6hfa)",

No worries, we'll have plenty to choose from, like, \"When are you the happiest?\" and, \"If you were going to become close friends with me, what would I need to know about you?\" We'll give you ground rules to make sure you feel comfortable and safe sharing as much of yourself as possible while still feeling in complete control of how much you divulge.",

It\u2019s a great opportunity to grow on a deep level and moreover I hope to share these experiences with others.\n\n**Let\u2019s take part in some of the following types of activities:**\n\n* Visit art and history museums\n* Take a class on an interesting subject\n* Read or research a particular topic and discuss in a cafe or hybrid\n* Thoughtful conversations in a park or garden over a picnic\n* Discuss life goals and how we can help achieve them\n\nI believe in depth and high quality and aim to build a community around those who seek the same.\n\nAdditionally, as we mature, I aim to encourage creative activities centered around subjects that help us to do so. These can be great ways to learn a subject, express ourselves in doing so while creating in a collaborative way.\n\n**We value:**\n\n* Openness\n* Aesthetics\n* Personal Growth\n* Inspired thought\n* Creativity\n* Responsibility of self and to others\n\n**Conduct**\n\nI am personally a huge supporter of the sovereign individual and that we may have many approaches to life, so I am very careful and thoughtful about any \"rules\" for a group. That said, here's what I have currently which I think are entirely minimal and fair.\n\n*\\* With regards to any current events/political conversations \\**\n\nI understand that in a group like this those kind of conversations come up. That said, I ask that whenever someone expresses a view point they consider the following:\n\n* Assume that there is at least one person in the group who thinks differently from you\n* That person has thoughtful come to their position (no matter how awful you think it is) and is coming from their own informed and good place\n* That person would not feel attacked or marginalized for your expression\n\nOf all of the \"conduct\" policies this is the most important one to me.\n\n\\* Spam \\*\n\n* This goes without saying but I'll remove anyone immediately who joins the meetup with the sole intention to post spam on discussion threads.\n\n\\* Using my personal contact \\*\n\n* Unfortunately this had to come up. But for convenience I have given out my number and it had been misused in one rare instance. If you have anyone's contact, please use it respectfully. A rare instance where I removed a member was receiving an inappropriate text at 4:30 am.\n\n\\* RSVP \\*\n\n* This isn't a hard \"rule\" but please do your best to update your RSVP if your plans change as soon as you can. I am good at a adapting and I respect that people's plans change but knowing what to expect as soon as possible helps me greatly.\n\n**FAQs:**\n\n* Did you get your name from that episode in \"The Office\"?\n    * Yes\n* Do I need to be knowledgeable in a particular subject matter?\n    * Absolutely not! This is an opportunity to learn and grow together. That being said, if we're having a discussion as part of Book Club activity or something similar, I may provide suggested materials. I know time is limited so I will also start conversations with materials we can view or read together before diving deep into an event.\n* Can I suggest an event?\n    * Yes you may. That being said, I have particular goals with the group and may be very selective (hope you understand). I am focused on experiences that take time and dissection to appreciate. For this reason, while **I make no judgements, there will be no events related to Alcohol, Recreational Drugs or nudity - this includes things like Wine Tasting and Figure Drawing.**\n* I RSVPed but I may not be able to attend\n    * No reason to provide an explanation or anything, but please update your RSVP as soon as possible so that I can adapt accordingly. It helps planning greatly and is appreciated if you can do that a day or two prior and not last minute.\n* What if I need to run late?\n    * I'll do what I can to make that work, but I have noticed that it can be challenging to track others down if it's a museum meetup and sometime late members struggle in integrate as well. So I highly encourage you to arrive promptly if you can.\n* Will events be online, in-person, hybrid?\n    * I hope to build on personal connections and so I will aim for mostly in-person events. That being said, some events that lend themselves to a virtual setting may have an online component.\n* For online/hybrid events, do I need to be part of The Greater Boston Area?\n    * Nope! All are welcome!\n* The club's name specifies Cambridge, will most in-person events be in Cambridge?\n    * Not necessarily, though that is where I am currently living. I will try to facilitate a variety of events in the Greater Boston Area, in which all are welcome. To be honest the alliteration of Cambridge Culture Club (CCC) just rolled off the tongue for me :)",

The discussions are always great because there is a lot of commonality and it\u2019s great to hear how others are approaching similar problems of handling scale, building teams, and generally helping our respective companies grow. In fact, we always ask ourselves why don\u2019t we all get together... So, welcome to BosOps.\n\nThe focus: It\u2019s simple. This is an opportunity to meet, teach and learn from other local technology leaders who are primarily focused on -and responsible for- 24X7 technical operations of their companies.\nThere are no talks, no presentations. \u00a0Just a relaxed, casual networking event where you can meet other people in your community and share your experiences in building systems, scaling teams, and supporting the business. \u00a0\nJoin the daily conversations in our BosOps slack: [https://bosops-slack-invite.onrender.com/](https://bosops-slack-invite.onrender.com/)",

        "description": "<p>Welcome! This meetup is to help further our skills in Data Science. I have taken numerous online classes and have always wanted to share my experiences with other online learners. I have used online forums and posted to threads, but I realized I wasn\u2019t building a network around me.</p> \n<p>There were also times when the process felt lonely and frustrating. Have you ever started a class online and run into an issue downloading the software that could be solved with someone glancing over your shoulder to help you? Ever wondered what other platforms are out there and if it\u2019s worth your time and money? Wouldn't it be nice to get an opinion of someone you know that has taken classes for these topics?</p> \n<p>In this meetup I plan to have events (online and in person) to share experiences, new technology, trends in the industry and find ways to bridge the gap between online learning and learning in a classroom. I hope you join and contribute to building this community of online learners in the Boston area, trying to improve and stay on top of the ever-changing field of Data Science!</p>",

It is not just a set of exercises but a living science that will open up to you gradually as your meditations become deeper and your experiences stronger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Sahaja</b> means \u2018<b>spontaneous</b>\u2019 while <b>Yoga </b>translates to \u2018<b>union</b>\u2019 and thus, Sahaja Yoga is a technique that helps us achieve the spontaneous union of our energy with the all-pervading energy. This union leads us to a state of meditation or thoughtless awareness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the meditation classes, we will show you how to achieve this state of thoughtless awareness and continue to meditate at home. You will also learn about the subtle chakras and channels, and how they govern the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of your lives.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sahaja Yoga Meditation is practiced in over 100 countries, is always offered free of cost, and is open to everyone. Come, try it out!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can also preview Sahaja Yoga Meditation here: <a href=\"http://www.discoversahajayoga.org\">www.discoversahajayoga.org</a></p>\n<p>You can check&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bostonmeditation.org/\">www.bostonmeditation.org</a>&nbsp;for more events happening in Boston area.</p>\n<p>For any questions, email us at: YogaMass@gmail.com</p>\n<p><br></p>",

        "description": "Interested in jug band music, early blues and jazz, home-made instruments? This meetup is for fans and musicians alike - a place to find out about what's happening in the vibrant world of jug band music here in the Northeast: performances by local jug bands, jug band jams, and festivals.\n\nWhat's Jug Band music, you ask?\nIt\u2019s rootsy, bluesy, jazzy, and fun! With roots from Appalachia, New Orleans, and Africa, jug band music started in the south (notably Louisville Kentucky and Memphis Tennessee) in the 1920\u2019s and 30\u2019s. Highly popular \"back in the day\", jug bands such as Gus Cannon\u2019s Jug Stompers and the Memphis Jug Band incorporated a variety of conventional and home-made instruments (such as spoons, washtub bass, and washboard), and, of course, featured jug-blowing as a rhythmic backbone. Jug band music could have quietly slid into obscurity if not for a revival in the 1960\u2019s by notable musicians such as John Sebastian, Jerry Garcia, Jim Kweskin, and Maria Muldaur. Today, the genre is alive and well, with several terrific bands playing right here in greater Boston and beyond.",

This group is also open to non-single parents who appreciate & support our situation (relatives, mentors, teachers, adult children of single moms, babysitters, etc.).\r\nThis meetup is unique from most because it is a chance for families to not only get together at least once a month, but to really be a supportive resource to single mothers.  If your sitter bailed at the last minute, you would call another mother within our community to help you out & she, in return, could count on you to reciprocate, without $$$.  Or if you are without a vehicle, but need to go food shopping, another mom would be able to support you as well.\r\nThis group is definitely lots of fun.  We have Moms' Nite Out/In, cool outings with the kids, pampering days, themed playdates & so much more!  I have enrolled business associates, qualified sitters & male mentors, just to name a few, who have offered their support as well.\r\nYou will have love, support, a voice that will be heard and friendships that will last a lifetime!",

Washington Valley area of NH. During the winter, we participate in snowboard races, ski races and social events with other groups in the area. During the summer, we hold organized weekends for paddlers, rock climbers, golfers, mountain bikers, and hikers. Come check out our photos from past events as they tell our story best.\nJoin our Meetup today to learn more about us, check out our fun events and meet our awesome members. Please note, Wedeln is a physical house up in North Conway NH that sleeps 70+ people. Joining this meetup facilitates coming up as a guest to the house, information on social events, etc. It does not get you a \"key\" to the house. Should you be interested in more information on how to get access or house membership, contact Tom for more information.\n\nGuests and new memberships at The Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club are **21+\u00a0 only**.",

        "description": "Greetings Photographers! Please use your best email to sign up for this group or you will miss last minute announcements when there is a change in venue due to weather.\u00a0\nThis Boston based photography meetup offers workshops and classes that help you take your photos from like to LOVE. \u00a0If you are ready to learn how to take better photos, but you don't want to get bogged down with all the technical stuff, then you're going to love this group. WE are the most active photography meetup group in the Greater Boston Area with events nearly every weekend.\nWe are not just a fun social photo group, we are also serious about improving the quality of the photos by focusing on what matters most. How to use your camera, how to see more creatively, and how to use composition to make the most of every subject.\u00a0\nJoin us to have fun while photographing the beauty of your life. You will meet some great people, discover new areas of Boston off the beaten path, and gain confidence in your photography skills. Beginners and intermediate photographers welcome. \u00a0You can see more of my photography and instructor experience on my main website:\u00a0[https://www.curioussoulphotos.com](https://www.curioussoulphotos.com)\n\u201c\u00a0Outstanding for broadening your photographic vision and discovering your specific strengths. Teaches the ingredients of creativity in a clarifying and actionable way.\u00a0\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0[Henry Gessau](https://www.meetup.com/TakeBetterPictures/members/12813018/)\u00a0on Feb 18, 2018.\nI\u2019ve taken 8 photography workshops with Suzanne and learned a great deal at each one. Her planning is incredible. In addition to scouting the best places to photograph for the theme of the workshop, she provides such helpers as maps, example images and reminder cards outlining the key points. These cards allow us and encourage us to practice after the workshop is over. We are invited to post our images on the site and comment on each other\u2019s work. She comments on each person\u2019s endeavors as well. Her style of teaching involves getting to know each student (many of us are repeat students) and provide guidance as we shoot during the workshop. I feel I have really improved my skills due to her excellent teaching! (Did I mention how much fun we have?)

Or you have tried to learn online but found it difficult to apply what you learned out in the real world.\n    You'd like to learn how to take better pictures of things you find interesting. That could be nature, people, landscape, architecture, etc. Whatever you feel drawn to. **We are a learning group and each class builds specific skills to improve your photography. You also\u00a0receive constructive critique after class to help you get better and better.** If you are a life long learner, curious\u00a0about\u00a0photography you have found the right group.\u00a0\n    I personally lead each workshop so you receive clear, simple instructions to quickly build your skills and creative confidence. I have a masters degree in education, worked at Polaroid for 15 years, and 20 years of experience training people to see creatively. **During each class you also receive handouts so you can practice the skills on your own. I am a master level instructor so know how to present content in a\u00a0clear precise way that sticks with you.**\n    You would like to explore related topics like creative photography and mindfulness? This unique approach encourages you to slow down, **take fewer photos of higher quality** by experiencing the beauty of your life.\n\n![](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/6/b/0/600_437662192.jpeg)\nWhich is better A. or B. \u00a0\nAnd the best part? The techniques you'll learn will have an immediate impact on your photography. You'll see an instant improvement and you'll also have an opportunity to get positive and constructive feedback for your work in a supportive environment.\n\nIf that sounds good to you, then I invite you to join our group. You'll learn a lot, meet some warm and wonderful people, and have lots of fun while you improve your photography. I'm looking forward to meeting you in person soon.\nAll I ask is PLEASE INCLUDE A REAL PICTURE OF YOUR FACE for your profile description when you join us. I can't find you in a crowd when we meetup if you use a photo of your cat:)\u00a0\nYou can learn more about my background and philosophy at \u00a0[https://www.curioussoulphotos.com](https://www.curioussoulphotos.com)\n[http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/flow-tography-better-photos/id499049037?mt=11&uo=4](http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/flow-tography-better-photos/id499049037?mt=11&uo=4)\u00a0My book\u00a0\nWelcome to the group!\nSuzanne",

This will be conducted in an \"Office Hours\" format where group members assist each other in resolving day-to-day challenges of implementing Generative AI projects using popular advanced systems and tools.\nEach session will start with a specific subject, such as:\n\n* how to optimize your data files for inclusion in a RAG system\n* data curation strategies\n* cloud vs. local implementation\n* using agents effectively\n* data governance and security\n* advanced processes and settings to improve response quality\n* leveraging APIs\n* comparison of results using popular tools, and input file formats\n* taking advantage of context windows for rich input\n* using multiple tools for robust solutions\n* new model trends\n    Much of each session will involve group members bringing their challenges to the group where we can collaboratively discuss solutions. Discussion of models and databases will be limited to how they can be leveraged for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n    Note that this meetup covers practical implementation issues using (sometimes advanced) Generative AI systems and tools. If your interested mostly in building models this is not your Meetup.\n\nThe remote meetings have limited space available. We ask that all participants be US-based. Onsite meetups will be conducted in the Boston, MA area.",

The **Exploring Group** does somewhat more ambitious hikes Northeast of Boston and may include an occasional bicycling or ski event. Both value social interaction and could end with a gathering at an eatery nearby.\nYou are encouraged to join either of these two groups if not already a member.",

This activity is FREE to join, so bring your favorite percussion instruments and jam with us. The easiest way to start is with djembes and other hand drums. I will also have some shakers available. We will begin by meeting for about 2 hours (2 - 4 pm) on Saturdays in Torbert Macdonald Park in Medford, MA. This is in the Mystic River State Reservation. My thought is to meet by the \"musical fence\"; this is a location that is ripe for music-making. I don't yet have any extra drums for people to play on, but if you give me a little bit of notice, I could probably procure some. The goal of the group is to get some like-minded people together, maybe make some friends, and create some fantastic percussion music. Come as you are, bring a drum if you can; bring a chair and some water; wear sunblock. Let's jam!\n\nA note about me: I have a degree in music education and I have studied many instruments. I love hand drumming, especially the djembe, and I have many ideas for drum beats that will be accessible for beginners and still exciting enough for the experts. I am available to teach the basics if you are new to drumming, but I am equally happy if you bring your own ideas and expertise. Let's make some music!",

The NESFA clubhouse is located at 504 Medford Street in Somerville.\nNESFA hosts a variety of events at the clubhouse in the course of a month. All events at the clubhouse are free to anyone. You don't have to be a member and you do not have to join. All you have to do is open the door and walk in. Game Days, Game Nights, Media Days, Book Discussion Group, the Annual Picnic, the Halloween party, the Bah Humbug game day, and the general Wednesday night gathering are all free to attend. Details for each will be posted in each event listing.\nBoskone runs in February, and it's one of the longest running SF conventions out there. Many famous authors attend each year, along with editors and publishers. There are discussion panels, nightly events, an art show, filkers, a dealer's room, and I personally run the game room.\nNESFA is also the parent organization of NEGC (New England Gaming Convention). Two have run thus far. Both were 1-day gaming cons.\nNESFA Press is the publishing wing of NESFA. NESFAns handle all aspects of the work, from the negotiations to the editing.\nYou'll see NESFA set up at the Boston Book Festival as well.\ninfo@nesfa.org is the general email address for nesfa. You can also contact me at my email address. The web address is [www.nesfa.org](http://www.nesfa.org)\u00a0\u00a0\nTo get to the clubhouse, you can take the 80 bus (drops you off a block away in either direction), and the 89 bus (drops you off on Broadway. Cross Broadway and go past the lights. NESFA will be on your right). There is a small lot in the back for cars (first come, first served) and metered parking on the street. I look forward to seeing you at the various events and thank you for taking the time to check out NESFA.",

Do you self-identify as being in recovery of any sort (from a substance, gambling, an eating disorder, sex/love addiction, trauma, debt, depression, bipolar, codependency, etc)? Our Writers in Recovery Meeting is an engaging, safe place for people to enhance their recoveries via creative writing and fellowship. In the meeting, we check-in, read a prompt, write on it, share what we\u2019ve written, and connect with our peers.</p>\n<p>This is not an AA meeting or a twelve-step fellowship; however, all are welcome who are interested in exploring the intersection of creative writing and recovery lifestyle. The groups are intended to be encouraging and supportive, using writing as a vehicle for self-reflection, self-expression, and human connection.</p>\n<p>The group is completely free of cost and meets every Thursday (starting 1/7/2019) from 6:30-8:30 PM at Right Turn (440 Arsenal St in Watertown.) Enter through the main entrance on the side of the building (it says 440 Arsenal above the door). Go up the stairs, through the door and we meet in the Elvis Room (the door is labeled). Bring a journal and a writing implement. Feel free to bring any writing prompts as well!</p>\n<p>RSVPing to this post is not necessary in order to attend, just show up! If you have any questions at all, please don\u2019t hesitate to message the group organizer. Look forward to seeing you there!</p>\n<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Until further notice, we are temporarily meeting only via teleconference, so until we can again arrange to meet in person in the metro west Boston area, please do both RSVP and message the group organizer to ask to be added to the teleconference group.<br></p>",

Join us for delicious gatherings featuring decadent cheeses, succulent steaks, potlucks, hotpot dinners, and cheese tastings. Come charcuterie and chill! I decided to make a group dedicated just to my events involving food since they\u2019ve been so popular.\n\nThis group will host intimate, fun gatherings for chill, beginner-friendly evenings of meaningful relaxation and indulgence. Basically, we\u2019ll be enjoying yummy food paired with mindfulness activities!\n\nWe\u2019ll meet at my speakeasy/pirate ship-themed place in Somerville. As a yoga/meditation instructor, I use fun, relaxed methods to help people find inner peace.\n\nMy goal is for this to become a group where you'd actually hang out with people outside of the events too.\n\n***\n\nThis group is part of Peace Out Ski + Wellness Club, a high-energy mindfulness and skiing club. We host unique yoga and meditation parties in the Boston area.\n\nStill reading? Here\u2019s a mindfulness prompt:\n\nWhat do you want to remove from your life menu in the next 12 months? What would that taste like? Any condiments you\u2019d like to go with your plate of nothing?\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n**FB group: Looking for ways to stay connected w/fun people in their 30s and 40s who value mindfulness and being active?**\n\nI just made a brand new private Peace Out 30s and 40s mindfulness Facebook group - where you can connect with like-minded new friends! I'll be posting motivational quotes, fun themed costumes and mindfulness stuff, plus our upcoming yoga/meditation classes there :) Check it out here - [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1045183780505725](http://clicks.meetup.com/ls/click?upn=u001.NY3oBFzZ5LJDG7YcnfSAKu-2FXfTGw-2FvPXD7PPRLlSXtchIrY2eHTenBALLFxscd1-2FMAMGwI-2BGI8xvsNw7UlHQRg-3D-3D5uSm_xdUTvUhIjWlSJgufBblll4-2FcuaVca123SZLk5EUYKf9BYU9plMczE-2BisCz8YQYpOJfQ9riIO9e56TijOxQDg04vfiYN9xUOc7g0etBs7ii-2FyMU9mf4D6uu3MnBu-2FsLkXEmGB75xZFUznmlRSCzU1InogPiejiCkIePSLzKZBzY0TBzeocrMrb9faqUaJ2rhWxk9fNjYSurbC-2FK0vjKcQ0Oox3yKpezEyG-2FyC0T9c5C-2F-2FMU861IHbFinNIJ5ioLwp9VA0R-2Bt81FY5glQ1QXNZFxwYqnvCDlI1JP5-2BT3lMjcU0PmY3JvqU-2Fa5aa8wIFDNVRJZ6Z8QOVkZ1xT3ytAFyVw7TbHMZWWkq3oahT36oJhptFzAudXrURipAe0x7EoPFlfsiCV6UOX3GiZe2CyZkuwkYTNH4HcgAc-2BzQ4azNRcd9y0E7kXgzwbH-2Bf9iPZQFcab-2FsUzVlrROzoyc9-2BA0zBE23KKRqRCUFxlDAl9AtkjwLk4JJGeWWlTMP-2BQMOOgvuGs5sRtpcbaucq9RNKflwNwxOyt7WL-2BATlEW64z2iZP8tg033AeyOV1-2Bw0SQB21oXjskAx-2F9Ee1clOtCCO1gJV6JFdmD6hvGlozTO2nYcYTd1lMEVPU3kRGLZFbe-2BDwanimXlUfEgUgf2w69kciDXynwoXXu4TCNz5DU-2B8yDB0o4SdmTzKxNbh-2FzGnqfj6hfa)",

I joined a wonderful and intimate cohort at Boston University and received my MFA in Film & Television - Screenwriting Concentration. Since, I've spent time mentoring & coaching writers through many forms, including as a Professor of Screenwriting at multiple universities in New England, an instructor of Creative Writing courses at the Muse Writers' Center, and owner of my consulting business, The Write Story Editorial. \n\nIf you have a project or would like to start a project and want to receive one-on-one feedback through The Write Story Editorial, schedule a consult with me via email [chevahnthewriter@gmail.com]\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/TheWriteStoryEditorial\n\nI look forward to meeting You and Experiencing Your Work,\nChevahn\n\n[Meetups will be both virtual and in person]",

There are active organizations for young Catholics, for queer Catholics, and for Catholic women \u2013 but no circle specifically for those of us who are all three. So let\u2019s make the space, because we bring unique perspectives! </p>\n<p>Since there are already progressive Catholic organizations that focus on liturgy and advocacy, this affirming community space will instead focus on the diverse, daily spiritual practices that grow our relationships with God. Gatherings may include such activities as:</p>\n<p>Reading and discussing sacred texts <br>Taiz\u00e9 chant or similar circle singing <br>Labyrinth-walking <br>Centering prayer <br>Retreats <br>Volunteering <br>Going to mass together <br>Attending feminist theological gatherings </p>\n<p>\u2026and other Catholic spiritual practices that inspire us! </p>\n<p>In the true spirit of a circle, all members will have opportunities to lead gatherings. The group is based in the greater Boston area. To be added to the gathering notification email list, contact YQCWofBoston@gmail.com or meetup message the organizer. You can also be in touch with YQCW across the globe by joining our Young Queer Catholic Women facebook group.</p>\n<p>WHO WE ARE <br>As the title indicates, this group is intended for queer Catholic women, ages 21-40. You are also welcome if: <br>--you are a young adult Catholic who is trans/NB/GNC/etc. <br>--you are a young adult queer woman/gender minority of another denomination/faith who is interested in learning more about progressive Catholicism and engaging in interfaith dialogue</p>\n<p>For the privacy of all members, the member profiles and meeting locations will only be visible to group members. The organizer will review each profile before a person is added to the group. Please include a recent photo of yourself with your profile.</p>\n<p>HOLDING THE SPACE <br>Many women and queer Catholics understandably have difficult histories with their faith identity. However, the purpose of this group is not to focus on past pain, but rather to bear witness to each other\u2019s spiritual journeys moving forward. We can create a new, positive, inclusive model of Catholicism. Please bring kind words, an open heart, and your best, whole self!</p>",

        "description": "Are you interested in finding cool things in nature? From plants, animals, and trees to fungi, there is an enormous amount of life in our forests that goes unseen by most. Would you like to learn about different fungi and plant species native to Northeastern America? YES! Well, join us for a walk in the woods with experienced foragers where we will learn about fungal and plant species identification, foraging skills, and maybe even take some choice edibles back home to cook! The goal of this group is to bring together like-minded individuals who share an interest in learning, exploring, and being outside with cool people. Anyone is welcome to join this group, no foraging experience or knowledge is required.\n\nWe will go on foraging walks in various locations surrounding the Boston area, most events will be held in Eastern Massachusetts, However we will also venture out to different locations periodically and go on some wilderness hikes in New Hampshire. During the walks we move at a slower pace to make sure we don't miss anything, and we do venture off the beaten path as most fungi are not directly on the trail (I recommend wearing longer socks!)\n\n**What to Bring:**\n-Clothes for the Weather\n-Water and a Snack\n-Foraging Basket/Vegetable Bags/Field Guide (Not Required, I will bring my own)\n-Yourself and any interested friends!\n\n**Rules:**\n-Be respectful of the outdoors (Pack in and Pack out)\n-Be respectful of group members\n-Do not eat any plant or mushroom that you are not 100% sure of (Best to use multiple sources to ID)\n-Have fun!\n\n**About Me:**\nMy name is Darren and I have been foraging mushrooms for 4 years as a hobby. This is my most favorite hobby as you never know what cool looking thing you are going to find next, and you may even be rewarded with a tasty meal. I have helped lead foraging events with the Bay Staters for Natural Medicine - Definitely check them out->(https://www.baystatersnm.org/). You can find some of my coolest finds on my IG @massachusettsmushrooms",

        "description": "Meet others interested in all aspects of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Gather to discuss Development, Standards, Networks, Marketing, Promotion and Business opportunities using AWS. Our group is more technical, so we look for relevant topic matter, and stay away from sales presentations. This Meetup is open to anyone interested in learning more about Amazon Web Services!\n**And now for some details...**\n**Since the lockdown ...**\nWe've switched to zoom based meeting like everyone else.\u00a0 We've been meeting alternate Thursdays since March 2020, with meetings starting at 5:30.\u00a0 Our Twitter handle is Awsugboston.\n\n**Upcoming Scheduled Meetups:** In general, we meet alternate Thursdays, from 5:30-7pm, with 5:30-5:50pm for socializing, and 6-7pm for presentations. Sometimes we do a single long presentation, other times we have several shorter (30-40 minute) presentations.\u00a0 \n**Attendance:** We usually have an attendance of approx. 30-60+ depending on location and topic - and we normally hold these Meetups in the Boston area - however, we are branching out to other areas/facilities. Our attendees are generally in the middle ground between novice and expert, with many in the dev/ops space. If an RSVP list is desired, this can be provided to the host sponsor, however, it ONLY includes the member's Meetup profile name (may not be their real name) and profile link - it does Not contain direct email contact info.\n**Presentations:** If you wish to present, contact the Organizer (see below). Suggest a topic and an upcoming meeting(s) that you would be available to present. Then we will need an abstract of the presentation (title and descriptive info) and a bit about the presenter (brief bio, just a few words). We generally have 2-3 presentations/presenters per Meetup without repetition from recent past meetups. If 2 presentations, then these are usually 40min with Q&A. Usually the main sponsor is provided the choice of topic and presentation slot. Our attendees are looking for technical depth and NOT a sales pitch - so please keep this in mind when proposing and creating your presentation. Sometimes it is what you don't say that is important - for example, if you wanted to expose the need for your solution, you can point out all the Amazon-native methods of solving a problem, and in the presentation it becomes clear that an additional solution is needed. Again, we stay away from sales presentations.\nIt\u2019s important that speakers speak loud and clear, in the event a PA system is not available. Also, when questions are asked, the presenter should repeat the question so that all can hear and understand the context of the answer.\n**Presentation - Slides:** Usually there are requests for slides after a presentation. We request that presenters post a link to the slides used, as a comment in the applicable Meetup event page. Any comments go to the entire group of subscribers (who have notifications enabled).\n**Sponsorship:** Sponsors have first dibs on presentations (which need to be AWS-centric and Not a product demo). Sponsors are provided time during the Meetup to address attendees. In general the sponsors arrange food/drink AND location - and this can be split up (co-sponsorship). The moderators of this Meetup group do not arrange or supply the meeting space.\u00a0 We can always add an event to the calendar, so if you are interested in sponsorship, please reach out to the Organizer (see below).\u00a0Special events are welcome.\n**Sponsorship - Food/Drink:** We really appreciate our food sponsors and provide them extra time in self-promotion. Food and drink selection is up to the sponsor. Usually a mixed assortment of pizza and salad works well - but this is up to the sponsor. Pretty simple fare for this crowd - and usually no alcohol (but optional if the venue allows). **The food sponsor makes all the arrangements** \\- including flatware\\, napkins\\, cups\\, plates\\, water\\, condiments\\, etc\\. Food is consumed as people arrive and mingle around 6:30pm\\, and we usually get started with the presentations by 7pm\\. To help with arranging food\\, here is a [link to ezCater](https://www.ezcater.com/raf/9190f46efd), which makes it easy to select a restaurant close to the venue, estimate the food required to support the 50-75 people, place the order online, and make the delivery arrangements. Expect to pay approx. $500 for food/drink.\n\n**Sponsorship - Location:** We are open to a variety of locations. Minimum requirements include a facility that can host approx. 60 attendees, with projector and screen available. The only time we have needed amplification is when the meeting area has significant background noise (like certain climate control systems, or open environments where sound does not carry well). The facility should support groups who allow food and drink on premise. Please specify if alcohol is Not permitted, and/or if there are drinks/snacks or benefits that the facility supplies beyond the space hosting. Usually, attendance requires RSVP for security check-in (if required). Be aware that Meetup members do Not necessarily use their legal name in their profile. Any prerequisites need to be spelled out (like requiring attendees to sign an NDA, or updating their profile with their legal name). The host location sponsor is responsible for posting signage to make it very clear where attendees need to go for the meetup. Please supply any special instructions with regard to directions, parking, security check-in, etc. - these will be posted on the Meetup site.\nNote: We have arranged with Amazon to use their Boston office several times a year. In general, these Meetups are reserved for sponsors who do Not have a facility to offer. If you require a facility, there are many locations throughout the Boston area, including places like [WeWork](http://wework.com), that can be contacted to help facilitate a meeting space.\n\n**Sponsorship - Other Items:** There are other forms of sponsorship available, including supplying swag, offering door prizes for info cards being filled out, and covering the Meetup site hosting fees. Please reach out to the Organizer (see below) for further details and arrangements.\n**Promotion of Other Events:** We receive many requests to post outside events, functions, positions, and other items to the Meetup group. Members have provided direct feedback that they do Not want any sales presentations or unrelated solicitations. So, we keep it simple, stay focused on the purpose of this Meetup, and provide opportunities for companies to sponsor or present, and make announcements during the Meetup. In addition, comments can be posted to any of the scheduled Meetup pages on the Meetup site. These comments go out to the entire membership (who have notifications enabled).\n**Attendee List:** We are often asked about providing presenters and sponsors the attendee list. Unfortunately, many Meetup registrants use nicknames, and emails are not available. If an RSVP list is desired, this can be provided to the host sponsor, however, it ONLY includes the member's Meetup profile name (may not be their real name) and profile link - it does Not contain direct email contact info. However, presenters/sponsors can post to the Meetup site, commenting on the particular meeting page, which goes out to the entire group (who have notifications enabled). In the comments you can indicate follow-up contact info, offer slides, and drive response to another web link where more info can be gathered from attendees.\n\n**What Next?**\u00a0\n*Sponsors:* Identify a meetup date and reach out to the moderator with a description of your desired involvement, and any additional questions not answered above.\n*Presenters:* Provide topic/abstract and indicate when you could be available to provide the presentation.\n\n**Reaching the Meetup Group Organizer:** Brian Tarbox,\u00a0briantarbox@gmail.com\u00a0\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n**AWS Boston Meetup Code of Conduct**\n\n\n\n\nOur community is dedicated to providing an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.\nWe do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Slack and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the community organizers.\nIf you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing BrianTarbox@gmail.com, contacting us at awsbostonmeetup.slack.com, or via the website.\nAll our speakers, attendees, and anyone else taking part in Boston AWS User Group activities are expected to familiarize themselves with these policies. While these policies are open to discussion and change over time, participation in the community implies that you are willing to abide by the policies in place at that time.\n**AWS Community Code of Conduct**\nOur community\u2019s code of conduct (this document) is in addition to the [AWS Community Code of Conduct](https://aws.amazon.com/codesofconduct/), used by AWS communities like ours around the world. The two codes of conduct should generally align, but where they conflict please consider this document as authoritative.\n**Long Version**\nRespect yourself, and respect others. Be courteous to those around you. If someone indicates they would like to be left alone, let them be. Our event venues and online spaces may be shared with members of the public and employees of the venue; please be considerate to all patrons of these locations.\nHere are some behaviors we\u2019d like to see:\n\u2022 be nice!\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0welcome newcomers into your circle of discussion.\n\u2022\u00a0encourage current and new speakers by listening respectfully and asking relevant questions at the end of talks.\n\u2022\u00a0help clean up at the end of an event.\n\u2022\u00a0be considerate of others when entering and exiting the venue. There may be people working or neighbors sensitive to noise.\nHere are some examples of behaviors which are not appropriate:\n\u2022\u00a0offensive verbal or written remarks related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion.\n\u2022\u00a0sexual or violent images in public spaces (including presentation slides).\n\u2022\u00a0deliberate intimidation.\nstalking or following.\n\u2022\u00a0unwanted photography or recording.\n\u2022 sustained disruption of talks or other events.\n\u2022\u00a0drunk or under the influence of illegal drugs at an event venue.\n\u2022 inappropriate physical contact.\n\u2022 unwelcome sexual attention.\n\u2022 sexist, racist, or other exclusionary jokes.\n\u2022\u00a0unwarranted exclusion from the community based on age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion.\nCommunity members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.\n**Reporting**\nAny time that you feel this code of conduct is being broken, or the conduct of speakers or attendees is distressing to you, you should always feel comfortable to report it, knowing that you will be taken seriously, and that it will be appropriately investigated and dealt with. There are a few different avenues for reporting.\nPersonally, to members of the organizing committee by emailing BrianTarbox@gmail.com,\nDirectly, either in person or on Slack to one of our organizers\nAnonymously, at tbd. Anonymous reports will go to all members of the organizing committee.\nAll complaints made in any of these ways will remain confidential, be taken seriously, investigated, and dealt with appropriately.\nPersonal reports are always much better since there is only so much investigation that can be done without the ability to speak to the reporting party. When you report personally to any of the above people, please make sure you tell them if there is anyone specifically you do not want them to speak to about the issue. Normally the person you report to will discuss the report with other team members and/or the reporting mentors.\n***What happens after you file a report?***\nYou will receive an email from the organizing committee acknowledging receipt of your report. The committee will meet to review the incident and determine:\n\u2022 What happened.\n\u2022 Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.\n\u2022 Who the bad actor was.\n\u2022 Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone\u2019s physical safety.\nIf this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety, the committee\u2019s immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an \u201cofficial\u201d response until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe. Once the committee has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:\n\u2022 Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).\n\u2022 A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved.\n\u2022 A public reprimand.\n\u2022 An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to \u201ctake a week off\u201d from events or Slack).\n\u2022 A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Melbourne AWS User Group spaces (events, Slack, etc.)\n\u2022 A request for a public or private apology.\nUnless they\u2019re anonymous, we\u2019ll respond to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.\nOnce we\u2019ve determined our final action, we\u2019ll contact the original reporter (if we can) to let them know what action (if any) we\u2019ll be taking. We\u2019ll take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don\u2019t guarantee we\u2019ll act on it.\n**Speakers**\nPresentation material should be appropriate for people of all ages.\nAny public presentation which is part of any event, including but not limited to presentations, lightning talks, recruiter/job position or other promotions, mailing list posts and forums, is subject to this code of conduct and thus may not contain:\n\u2022 sexual or violent imagery.\n\u2022 exclusionary language.\n\u2022 insults or personal attacks.\nPresenters are asked to avoid language which is not appropriate for an all-ages audience as much as possible.\nIf the subject matter of the presentation cannot be presented adequately without including language that could be considered offensive, this should be pointed out in advance, at the beginning of the talk and in the schedule.\nIf presenters are unsure whether their material is suitable, they are encouraged to show it to an organizer before their session.",

        "description": "The purpose of this group is to bring together like-minded individuals who are interested in starting a tiny farm business at home or already have one and want to join and share their experiences with the rest of us. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself, but I see this as a great opportunity to have industry professionals join in and answer questions that we all have about growing and marketing and business in general.\n\nAs I write this in September 2023, I am just thinking about my future tiny farm and collecting knowledge and bits and pieces to see this as a reality in my future. I know their other tiny farms in greater Boston but they\u2019re hard to find on the Internet.\n\nHere is my bit on what the group is about - thanks to Chat GPT for this amazing writeup.\n\n\\*\\*Tiny Farm Network: Cultivating Small Wonders\\*\\*\n\nDive into the world of the Tiny Farm Network, where the charm of farming is ingeniously reimagined for urban spaces. Our community embraces passionate gardeners who transform overlooked nooks like garages, basements, and attics into lush, green sanctuaries. Even the tiniest plots of land come alive under the tender care of our dedicated members. It's not about the size, but the yield of one's passion and innovation.\n\nExplore gardens flourishing with delicate microgreens, the earthy aroma of freshly sprouted mushrooms, and a plethora of other pint-sized plants and products. Whether you have an expansive backyard or just a windowsill, the Tiny Farm Network is your gateway to sustainable, urban farming. Join us and discover the joy of small business growing, no matter the scale.\n\n\\*\\*Navigating the Green Frontier: Unity Amidst Competition\\*\\*\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of urban farming, competition is fierce. Each gardener and cultivator brings to the table a unique blend of innovation, honed through trials, errors, and triumphs. Yet, as members of the Tiny Farm Network, we recognize an invaluable truth: while competition drives us to excel, collaboration propels us further. By pooling our collective knowledge, techniques, and discoveries, we not only stay ahead of industry trends but also fortify our shared mission. Together, we're not just competitors; we're pioneers, navigating the verdant frontier of sustainable growth. Sharing our expertise ensures that every tiny farm, no matter its size, thrives in this dynamic industry.",

        "description": "<p>Greetings Electric Vehicle Enthusiasts!</p>\n<p><b>Welcome to SomEV Presents!</b>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We're here to help spread electric vehicle literacy! This is a group for anyone that is interested in learning more about electric vehicles (EVs); e-bikes, electric scooters, electric mopeds, electric cars, and electric vehicle conversions. In this monthly series, we explore all things electric. The format ranges from lecture-style classes about EV technology, to hands-on meetups where attendees get to roll up their sleeves and work on an actual electric car! We cover everything from the components that make up electric vehicles, like batteries, motors, regenerative braking systems, etc., to the EV's themselves and the infrastructure that supports them.</p>\n<p>All SomEV Presents events are completely free and open to the public. No prior knowledge of/experience with Electric Vehicles is required. Some events may have restrictions on the number of attendees due to space constraints, but all such information will be posted clearly on the meetup page in advance.</p>\n<p><b>About SomEV, Inc.</b></p>\n<p>We are SomEV: The Somerville Electric Vehicle Company. We are two battery-engineers-turned-electric-vehicle-makers with over a decade of experience working on various battery chemistries at the forefront of energy storage technology. From synthesizing the basic cathode powders for electrodes, all the way up through constructing fully-functioning battery packs and setting up production lines for commercial products; when it comes to batteries, we've done it all. With our unique insight into battery tech, we took a look at the current electric transportation industry and we asked ourselves, \"What would it look like if you started with the battery, and designed a transportation system around that?\"</p>\n<p>From this single question, SomEV was born. For more information, please visit our website: www.som-ev.com</p>\n<p>Part of our effort to change the electric vehicle industry involves giving back to the community; getting them involved early on and keeping them engaged along every step of the way. We want people to know more about electric vehicles and how they work. We want to hear what people have to say. And above all, we want to get people excited!&nbsp; This is the motivation behind <i>SomEV Presents</i>.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in hearing future updates about SomEV specifically, feel free to sign up for our mailing list here: www.som-ev.com/subscribe</p>\n<p><span>Regards,</span> <br></p>\n<p>Reece</p>\n<p>Organizer, SomEV Presents</p>\n<p><span>City Organizer, Meetup-Boston</span></p>\n<p>CTO, Co-founder | SomEV, Inc. |&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:reece@som-ev.com\">reece@som-ev.com</a></p>",

        "description": "Note, 01/2024: We have been on hiatus through the pandemic, and currently don't have a practice session. The pandemic is mostly over, but I need to find a venue, and a hopefully musician, to anchor the group. However, I am posting a monthly beginners session being lead by Ellery Klein at Powers Music School in Belmont. Please see the calendar for details.\n\nThis group is about getting together to learn and practice Irish Session Tunes, and to listen to Irish Music. I find learning tunes at sessions to be impossible, and while it is enjoyable to learn and play music at home, it would be fun to get together with others to play occasionally. I started this group to see if there are others like me. To start, we are meeting once a month to play tunes at a\u00a0fairly\u00a0slow tempo.\n\nBecause the goal is to learn tunes and to practice playing with others I'm guessing that this group will be made up of beginning and intermediate level musicians (If good anchor musicians want to show up all the better), and that we will choose sets of tunes to work on. This way everyone gets to play. Of course, this is all open to what the group wants to do as a whole. Tempos will be anywhere from slow (while everyone is first learning a tune) to comfortably fast (once we've learned a tune). I'd like to keep one specific monthly Meetup away from blistering tempos, although if anyone wants to become an assistant organizer to schedule something more like a session for this Meetup, they are more than welcome (I'll pay the Meetup fee. Anyone who becomes an Assistant Organizer will not have to contribute. The yearly fee is not a lot of money.)\n\nMy motivation comes from years ago when I belonged to a CCE Branch in Utica NY. We used to play together weekly, usually in someone's dining-room or living-room. It was a lot of fun to get together. And we all knew a common set of tunes after playing together for many years. Of course we had a great anchor musician, a guy who grew up in Ireland playing accordion. He was patient, and quite tolerant :) CCE in Boston does have Sunday sessions in Watertown, but they don't have a tune list as far as I know. And Watertown is a bit far from the T.\n\nThe format is open to whatever the group decides: We can start with new tunes played slowly, and work our way to tunes we have learned well, picking up the tempo as we go. We could also just mix new sets with old sets. I think the first format might be better if better musicians want to show up later to play faster tunes. This depends on who joins. Currently, I'm working my through Malley's 100 Essential Irish Session Tunes. We can choose to go through a collection like this (All great tunes), or we can put our own setlist together.\n\nSo here is to whatever happens!",

        "description": "This group is for you if you\u2019ve found yourself feeling increasingly isolated and disconnected from what used to make you happy. The people, the activities, groups, and habits that no longer serve you.\n\n**You feel lost and yearn for greater connection to others on a mental, emotional, spiritual level.**\n\nYou desire more meaning and clarity in your life.\n\nMaybe lockdown broke you and woke you to what really matters and now you\u2019re confused about how to quench the emotional and spiritual thirst you have for greater depth of connection to yourself and others.\n\nYou\u2019re on a healing path, working through childhood wounds, collective and life trauma that has you feeling stuck and confused.\n\n**You\u2019re leaning toward woo.**\n\nWe\u2019ll be covering many things that fall into the woo. So if this doesn\u2019t sound good it may not be the right time for you. You can join us later or join now and see what clicks.\n\nYou read or listen to podcasts and videos on self-development or spiritual materials such as those from Hay House and others. You cannot get enough of this stuff and you\u2019d like to share it with friends and family but they don\u2019t respond with the level of enthusiasm or interest you have and they may perceive you as annoying or \u201cout there.\u201d\n\n**If this is you, you\u2019re safe to share here.**\n\nWe\u2019ll be meeting in person in nature, cafes, beaches, green outdoor spaces, restaurants, co-working, and inspiring high vibe environments. If you know of good spots that pop into your mind when you read this, please share.\n\n**What we'll be doing together. The list will grow but here's what I envision for now.**\n\n\\- casually hanging out to get to know each other\n\\- visit places that inspire us and promote conversation\n\\- listen to and engage with invited guest speakers\\, coaches\\, healers\\, therapists\\, and experts to share topics the group cares about \\(you'll be polled\\)\n\\- gather for a shared meal\n\\- meet in nature for walks\\, hikes\\, swims\\, bikes\\, etc\\.\n\\- listen to live music\n\\- group meditations\n\\- specific book/film/shows or idea discussions\n\\- co\\-working sessions for people who want to be productive and crave connection and familiar faces \\- for solopreneurs\\, coaches\n\\- ideas for activities from the group as we get to know each other\n\nI\u2019m Boston-based but we can have meetups in neighboring areas like \u00a0Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Maine.\n\nWe\u2019re all on our own journey in life, yes. But we don\u2019t have to live in a bubble to heal and evolve. Coming together to connect and meet like-minded people is powerful. And we all need it now more than ever. Life is intense!\n\nSo many people I speak to and interview are in the middle of spiritual awakening and have feelings that swing from joy to sorrow and deep hopelessness, anxiety, and depression. Not being able to connect, discuss, laugh, cry, in person can amplify feelings of disconnection and hopelessness. They hunger for community offline and when they see others like them online they ask WHY it\u2019s not possible to have these connections in real life.\n\nIT IS POSSIBLE.\n\nWe just have to create it. And we will.",

        "description": "I've been organizing this first general social Waltham Meetup group for 7 years now. It's grown through FB now also. Can't wait to meet you all \ud83d\udc95\n\nA group for people in their 20's-30's-mid 40s within Waltham/Newton and surrounding areas to connect and get to know each other when we don't want to head into downtown Boston. Make new friends, explore the different restaurants/pubs in the area, join our book club events, our walking/hiking events in the summer and explore similar interests.\n\nThe goal of the group is to hopefully make meaningful connections along the way and build some friendships. Or have a fun time out socializing in a world these days where we get less of that each time. So let's get to it and let's meet some new people today!\n\nSome FAQ\u2019s about the group and details in general:\n\nA. A picture may be taken of our event by attending our Meetup event you consent to it being taken and posted only to our Meetup and private FB group.\n\nB. Member Photos: We require profile photos of yourself in order to be accepted into the group. This helps event organizers identify you and find you during events and be able to help you out should you need help finding the group.\n\nC. Fees from paid events: Keeping in mind that organizers have to pay for the organizer membership in order to keep the group running and make events these fees go to offset the current $380 membership. If at any moment, there's any extra we'll be putting it back into the events for the members.\nFundraising for the group is always appreciated. It only goes to offsetting costs of paying for the organizer membership. I'm trying to also include events free of cost to provide affordable options for people. Help me keep it this way if you found value in any of the events you participated in \ud83e\ude77\n\nD. Refund Policy:\n1\\. Events with a fee of less than $5:\nPlease note that the fee for this event is non-refundable, even if someone else takes your spot. This small fee helps the Meetup organizer cover the $380 membership cost and serves as a thank-you for their time and effort in organizing these events. It also helps ensure that those who RSVP are genuinely interested and committed to attending, reducing \"no shows\" and last-minute cancellations after reservations have been made.\nThank you for understanding and supporting the group!\n\n2\\. Events with a fee greater than $5: These would usually involve ticketed events\\. The general policy is if the Organizer/Host can get their money back\\, you\u2019ll get your money back \\- if you timely canceled\\. Once an event location has been paid\\, however\\, many times they won\u2019t issue a refund\\. If they don\u2019t refund us\\, we can\u2019t refund you regardless of how far in advance you canceled\\. That said\\, sometimes a refund can be issued IF you cancel at least a week in advance AND someone takes your spot\\. If you want to request a refund\\, message the event host via Meetup to discuss\\. Please note\\, if you cancel the day before or the day of an event\\, there are no refunds \\- regardless of the reason and regardless if someone takes your spot\\.\n\nE. No show policy: we understand things unexpected things happen, and plans can change. Organizers take time and effort out of their free time to plan these activities for everyone and plan around a certain number of people and it's disrespectful to them to be left waiting for people who aren't coming. They can also run into reservation issues with restaurants that have been kind enough to accommodate for us. That's why we politely ask everyone to change their RSVP to \u201cno\u201d if they can't make it or message the organizer ahead of time. We'll implement a 3-strike no-show rule before removing a member from the group.\n\nF. Event Organizers/Suggestions:\nThis group is looking for event organizers and assistants, as well as suggestions or ideas for upcoming events. If you're interested in a position, even if temporary to try it out, or have ideas for upcoming events please feel free to reach out to the main organizer.\n\nE.

Please include your first name a clear profile pic and take a few minutes to answer the profile questions to enable us to easily find you at events, learn a little about you ahead of time, and have some potential convo starters. We are open to new members. We are looking forward to having you join us and meetup with us in the near future.**\n\nThe SSDOMG has hosted nearly 300 events while dining at over 260 restaurants across the south shore since August 2006. Over 1,400 adults have been members of our group with over 300 attending at least 3 events, over 150 attending at least 5 events, and over 50 attending at least 10 events. Many friendships have been formed and favorite restaurants discovered!!!\n\nWe broadly define the South Shore as south of Boston along within and abutting Routes 3, 18, 24, and 95 with Route 44 as our 'lower border' for lack of a better term.\u00a0However, once in awhile we do expand our wings to points further south and southwest.\u00a0Our Event Descriptions have all the info you need to enable you to join us at the table. Attend an SSDOMG event to eat out for every dining occasion. Discover new restaurants, enjoy delicious meals and make satisfying conversation with friendly dining companions. Please read the Message Boards under the More tab for much more information. We hope you will have fun dining out with us on the South Shore!\n\n*If you are interested in joining the SSDOMG*, please answer all Profile questions. Upon approval, please log-in and RSVP to any Meetups already scheduled on the calendar. Please be advised that we only approve individuals as we do have members only events. Therefore, couples will be declined and asked to join individually.\n\n*In order to join the SSDOMG* you must have a clear profile photo and a legible first name (not a bunch of letters or words) in order to be approved to join the group. This is so we have a face to put with the name and a name that we can (hopefully) pronounce tp provide a positive welcoming warm and fun experience dining out for all. \n\n*Cash Only Policy* \\~ We have had a Cash Only policy since Day 1 as it's easier to handle the bill. Please be sure to have a couple of bills smaller than $20s. Sometimes a restaurant will provide separate checks, in which case you can use a credit card. Our event fees are $2 payable in cash, small bills (think $1s and $5s) only please.\n\n*No Show Policy* \\~ We like to treat others the way we would like to be treated and expect you to update your RSVP prior to the RSVP Deadline if you are no longer able to attend. It's simple common courtesy. You can read more about our No-Show Policy on our About Pages and soon in the Message Boards under the More tab.\n\nAs the purpose of the SSDOMG and Meetup is to actually meetup we request *you please attend your first event within two years of joining*. Those who joined prior to mid-2024 will have about three years. This is a new policy that went into effect in 2024 and has been (and is being) communicated several times.\n\n(Please Note: We are working on updating our About/Description to simplify it.)",

We are looking forward to seeing you soon!&nbsp; <br> <br><b>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ AND AGREE WITH THE RULES BELOW BEFORE YOU JOIN THIS GROUP!&nbsp;</b> <br> <br>MA Korean Language Group mission statement, policies and rules&nbsp; <br> <br>MA Korean Language Group is open to anybody who is interested in the Korean language and culture. The mission of this group is to provide members with fun and safe environment to meet people with the same interest. All activities in this group are done on a not-for-profit basis. We intend to keep this group as open and casual as possible. Therefore, we restrict our group policies and rules to the following very basic ones.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>How to apply for membership</b> <br>To be a member, you will need to go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/korean-7/\">the Korean Meetup page</a>, create a profile and introduce yourself. Your request will be reviewed by a Meetup organizer. If you are approved, you will have access to use the site. <br> <br><b>No solicitation <br></b>This group engages in not-for-profit meetings and activities with the sole intention of promoting friendship and cultural/ linguistic exchange between participating members. Any commercial activity or solicitation within the group is strictly prohibited. With exceptions of collecting the actual cost of food/beverages incurred in the meetings and any voluntary contributions made to the management of the group, no fees shall be collected from the members.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>When meetings are held&nbsp;</b> <br>Regular meetings are generally held weekly, on Friday evenings, at a location announced only to the members registered on the Meetup\u00ae website. The Friday meetings are open to all members of the group, and their guests. There are also occasional spin-off dinners, Noraebang, BBQ parties, excursions, movie nights, etc.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>How we view RSVPs</b> <br>Members are strongly encouraged to RSVP for the Friday meetings. RSVP is mandatory for spin-off meetings. Due to space limitation, events are capped to a certain number of people, with a waiting list. Members are asked to update their RSVP if their plans change. No-shows will be deprioritized in future events and automatically moved to the waiting list. We want everyone who is truly interested in attending our events to have equal opportunity in going. Holding a spot \u201cjust in case\u201d isn\u2019t cool.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>Be Respectful</b> <br>Respecting people's time, attention, personal choices, and personal boundaries is essential to creating safe and trusting communities. Be respectful in your interactions with members and in content posted on the platform. Event organizers will monitor and restrict behaviors that are dishonest, undermine the integrity of the group, violate personal boundaries, or serve to intentionally upset people. <br> <br>MA Korean Language &amp; Culture has the right to warn, suspend, or disqualify any member if our group policies and rules are not followed.&nbsp; <br> <br><b>Message Respectfully</b> <br>Any content sent privately to a member that is irrelevant, impersonal, unsolicited, promotional, or repetitive is spam, which is not allowed. <br> <br><b>Honor Requests for Distance</b> <br>If you are blocked, you\u2019re blocked. Members must accept and respect any member's decision to block a member from contacting them.&nbsp; <br> <br>Members should also accept and respect the organizer\u2019s decision to ban a member from a group. Creating new (fake) accounts to circumvent block or ban decisions is strictly prohibited. <br> <br><b>\u201cNo\u201d Really Means No: Special note about Harassment for Ladies and Men</b> <br>Consent is defined here as welcomed communications and actions to socially engage with a member. Engaging with anyone in a non-consensual way is strictly prohibited. If ever in doubt, ask for permission to engage further. <br> <br>We ask all members to exercise common sense when interacting with other meetup members. We understand that given our carefree social environment, there is the tendency to willingly and freely exchange personal contact information.&nbsp; <br> <br>However,&nbsp;<i>we strongly encourage</i>&nbsp;all of you to stop and think before giving someone your KakaoTalk ID or phone number. If it is not someone you feel comfortable with, tell them \u201cAs a general rule, I don\u2019t hand out my contact information to people I just met.\u201d It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s fair. And it\u2019s polite. <br> <br>If someone does not respect your verbal (or written) expressed wishes to not be contacted, or to not give out your personal information... <b>PLEASE TELL AN ORGANIZER IMMEDIATELY! </b>We want all of you to have a good time and to also be safe. <br> <br>Lastly, this Meetup is not a singles matchmaking service. We understand that we are all human adults and occasionally the interest for more connection happens. Love is a beautiful thing. However, we will not tolerate any sexual harassment, which includes non-consensual, unwelcome attempts at physical touching; cajoling, seduction, coercion, and manipulation with the intent to get romantic and/or sexual favors.&nbsp; <br> <br> <br>As you can see above, the policies and rules of this group assumes we all have common sense.&nbsp; <br> <br>Simply put, the rules are;&nbsp; <br> <br><b>1. Introduce yourself when you join the group.&nbsp; <br>2. Do not use the group to make money.&nbsp; <br>3. Regular meetings are held every Friday night.&nbsp; <br>4. Act respectfully to other members.&nbsp; <br></b> <br>Please feel free to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/messages/?new_convo=true\">contact us</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions.&nbsp; <br> <br>MA Korean Language Group Leadership Team <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>",

As part of this ongoing effort, MFP expects all participants to behave in a manner that is in accordance with our mission of friendly, open and welcoming spaces. MadFemmePride will do our best to directly address any behavior that violates this policy.</p>\n<p><i>Scope</i></p>\n<p>This policy applies to: organizers, members, guests of members,and participants not currently signed up as members on the MFP Meetup page. </p>\n<p><i>Guidelines</i></p>\n<p>Expectations for \u201crespectful and welcoming\u201d Participant Behavior*</p>\n<p>MadFemmePride participants are expected to be respectful and welcoming to everyone, regardless of race, creed, nationality, disability status, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender expression. </p>\n<p>MFP asks that all participants behave in a manner that does not make other participants feel unsafe or threatened.</p>\n<p>Participants are expected to be responsible for their own behavior. </p>\n<p>Respect the identities of others, including pronouns. If you are flexible about what pronouns you use for yourself, it is perfectly fine to say that. Please respect that for others, specific pronouns may be important, and hearing someone be dismissive of pronouns in general can be hurtful. You may be asked questions about your identity that you've never considered before -- please don't be flippant and answer sincerely and respectfully.</p>\n<p>Step Up, Step Back. Participants should be aware of how much space and time they may be taking up. If you notice that you have been speaking a lot during a group discussion, allow yourself to \u201cstep back\u201d and let others \u201cstep up\u201d to the mic. Step Up/Step Back is also a great way to encourage new or shy participants to make themselves heard. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Participants should give each other the benefit of the doubt when possible.</p>\n<p>Disagreements among participants should be handled civilly and respectfully. Disagreements can become heated, but that does not excuse insults or potentially violent behavior. </p>\n<p>MadFemmePride is a friendly space where friendships, romantic and/or sexual relationships can begin. When choosing to initiate flirtation or inviting someone to spend more time with you, know that your attentions may or may not be welcome; be mindful of the other person\u2019s reaction, and if they express clear discomfort or request that you stop, do so immediately and respectfully. </p>\n<p>Speak from your own experience and your own beliefs, and be ready to learn from others. MadFemmePride is a diverse group -- you may meet people whose lives are shaped by prejudices that are similar and also different from those you experience in your everyday life. Leave others space to share their own experiences rather than assuming you know what their background and culture is like.</p>\n<p><i>Opt-In Photography Policy</i></p>\n<p> &nbsp;Cameras are everywhere these days and difficult to avoid. Please be respectful if you decide to take photos by asking people if they want to be in your photos.</p>\n<p><i>Addressing Unsafe Behavior</i></p>\n<p>If someone's behavior is making you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, please ask them to stop or remove yourself from the situation. </p>\n<p>If someone says something that offends you, ask clarifying questions to determine what they intended. You can initiate a dialogue or you can chose to remove yourself from the situation. </p>\n<p>If the behavior or offensive language continues, please communicate this to an MFP Organizer either in-person, via email, via the Meetup page, or via phone. </p>\n<p>Participants who are unable or unwilling to respect the MFP behavioral guidelines will be asked to leave. </p>\n<p>*Specific events may have additional guidelines, please check the event description for details. <br></p>\n<p>Grassroots</p>\n<p>madFemmePride is an entirely grassroots&nbsp;organization. We stay connected through Meetup, which charges us about $100 every 6 months to host the group.

        "description": "<p>We are a community of dog owners working together to support and encourage safe dog socialization through structured weekly pack walks. (We are NOT a stand around and play group.) We will hold regular, structured off-leash group walks and nature hikes at various times and locations around the Boston metro west and neighboring areas. We urge participants to use our outings as an opportunity to encourage and reinforce positive socialization skills and the behaviors you want your dog to exhibit everyday in public.</p> \n<p>All types of dogs and people are welcome, but for everyone's safety, we have a few rules that we ask every participant follow in order to walk with us:</p> \n<p>*Required for membership: owning a dog.</p> \n<p>*Dogs should be tagged and up to date on shots</p> \n<p>*All dogs must be leashed until we begin our walk (retractable or flexi leashes will not be allowed; please use a standard or flat leash no more than 8 feet)</p> \n<p>*No face-to-face greetings for the dogs</p> \n<p>*Give every dog space before the walk, over excitement can create a ripple effect or a fight</p> \n<p>*Always bring a leash and poop bags to clean up after your dog</p> \n<p>*If dog will be off leash reasonable voice control is required</p> \n<p>*Out of courtesy to others on the trail, if we ever come upon a single hiker or a leashed dog, I ask that people leash their dogs while we pass.</p> \n<p>*Please be on time. To be very specific, when I ask that you be on time I ask that you be ready to walk at the time designated in the event. If you know you will need a few minutes to get yourself ready upon arrival, please show up 5-10 minutes early to give yourself that opportunity.</p> \n<p>*Not all dogs are created equal, or even want to be. We have a myriad of different dog personalities on our walks these days. While I think this is awesome, some of our dogs do not. This has presented some issues recently in maintaining a cohesive, balanced group and providing a stress free safe walk for both us and our dogs. Some of dogs are excited players and barkers, a number of us don\u2019t do well with puppies and other dogs can be nervous or reactive and just want to have a quiet walk together without much play. As a way of alleviating this issue and honoring our dogs\u2019 different personalities, we will split our walks into two groups: high energy and low energy. (I am clearly oversimplifying with these names, for the sake of ease) The night before or the morning of a walk (depending on how good you all are about finalizing you RSVP in advance) I will take personality/play style/energy level/age of the dogs attending (sorry people, this walk is about the dogs after all) into consideration and if I feel it is best I will split the group into these two sub groups to walk separately. I ask that people stick to these groups for the sake of safety and time constraints for that walk. If you genuinely feel your dog would be better served hiking with the opposing group to the one you\u2019ve been placed in please let me know after the walk and I will be happy to discuss it with you. &lt;br&gt;</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/f/b/600_435108635.jpeg\"></p> \n<p>&lt;br&gt;</p> \n<p>Attendance Policy: We have lots of new members joining this group who would like to attend meet up events. So, RSVP and Commit. I ask that you please be aware of what hikes you have RSVP'd yes to. When you are slated to attend a hike please commit to walking or dropping out and adjust your RSVP by 9 PM the night before a hike accordingly. When we organizers wake up early, drive up to 45 minutes/1 hour to our destination and either one person or no people show up because everyone has dropped out last minute it stinks. Please be respectful of our sacrifice and our time. We do our best to give notice if we must cancel I ask the same in return of you guys.</p> \n<p>I obviously understand we all wake up feeling sick or have car trouble and missing a hike last minute cannot be helped, and for that we will try to be understanding, but I expect those instances will be few and far between. So, to enforce this rule we will re-institute our 3-strike policy. Should you drop out of a hike after 9 PM the night before a hike, or not show up at all you will be given a strike, which the other organizers and I will keep track of. Upon your third strike we will remove you from the group and in order to be reinstated we will ask that you provide us with proof of a $20 donation to a canine-supporting charity/organization/rescue. &lt;br&gt;</p> \n<p><i>Disclaimer: Participation in this group is an at-will activity and has inherent risks for which Organizers are not responsible. Furthermore, Organizers of this group are not responsible for parking tickets or tickets from park officials. Off-leash activity is at owner discretion, and Organizers are not responsible for any injury to you or your pet. Dog safety is solely the owner's responsibility and if your pet is in an altercation it is up to the parties involved to settle for damages. It is also the responsibility of each participant to be familiar with the venue (eg, have a copy of a trail map with you).</i></p>",

The Center at West Woods is on one of the sacredest and peaceful places I've visited. (bring a warm outdoor gear - warm coat &amp; good foot wear.)</p> \n<p>In this 1-Day Woman's Gathering you will experience:</p> \n<p>* TAI-CHI and QIGONG with UNIVERSAL TAO BOSTON: <br>Enrich your learning and healing experience with a unique perspective for creating health and happiness to discover a depth of strength and peace within.</p> \n<p>* INNER WISDOM with DR. PATTI: Healing through our connection with self and the Power we posses as woman from the inside out.</p> \n<p>* WELLNESS &amp; YOU with PEG DOYLE: Discover both the essence &amp; emotion for our connection with each other with food. This will allow us to align our intentions for sustenance.</p> \n<p>* AUTHENTICITY with SARA NESS: Explore, through games and activities, the joy of feminine connection, our authenticity, and our acceptance of ourselves as we relate to one another.</p> \n<p>THIS ONE DAY WILL FACILITATE HEALING <br>This day will allow us the time to unplug from day-to-day life and focus on ourselves, with the intention that as we do this, we are better vehicles of service to Humanity. Research is showing that when we also focus on others, we experience more profound healing &amp; transformation, but when we only focus on ourselves we perpetuate anxiety and stress. So we begin the day with self and finish with service with others.</p> \n<p>The medicine you will receive this weekend is Sacred. We have set an intention to attract high vibrational women who are here to be their most aligned versions of themselves AND who care deeply about serving the world. Our intent is to support the powerful &amp; emphatic modern woman with deep self discovery and practical tools to keep themselves intact from the distractions of other's agendas. The world needs you full of Vitality, and we are here to support you.</p> \n<p>WHY I DID THIS</p> \n<p>There have been powerful women and experiences in my life that I wanted to share with others. This one day will open possibilities in the minds and hearts of all those who participate. Please call me personally if you want to talk.</p> \n<p>REGISTER NOW - SPACE IS LIMITED.</p> \n<p>Love, <br>Kathryn</p>",

What alienated children want their targeted parents to do! Source: In interviews with 40 adults who were alienated as children (ages at the time of interview range 19-63), 34 were raised by mothers alienators, and 6 had father alienators. \"Adult children of parental Alienation: Breaking the Ties that Bind\", by Amy J. L. Baker 2007\u00a0\u00a0Page 212: These \"Summary and Discussion comments\" can inspire your actions to save your children:\n1\\. Many of the adult children felt the targeted parent should have done more to fight for the relationship and prevent alienation\\.\n2\\. Many felt that the targeted parent was too naive and trusting and generally unaware of the motives of the alienating parents\\.\n3\\. They felt hurt and angry when the targeted parent finally gave up trying to have a relationship\\.No matter how adamant they had been that they wanted nothing to do with the targeted parent\\, they were still shocked when the parent respected their choice and walked away\\. This was usually experienced as rejection\\.\n4\\. When their alienated parent did not call or write or send presents\\, this also hurt\\, especially because the alienating parents took full advantage of any lapse on the part of the targeted parent\\.\u00a0The adult children had resented being put in the position of having to defend someone \\(the targeted parent\\) who provided \"ammunition\" to the alienating parent\\.\n5\\. Even though they understood that their alienating parent would probably belittle any cards or letters sent and would restrict all attempts at contact\\, they still wanted the targeted parent to continue to send cards and letters\\.\n6\\. A corollary point is that the adult children did not feel that the targeted parent should have believed or responded to their child's rejection\\.\n7\\. Regardless of how adamant they had been that they wanted nothing to do with the targeted parent\\, they still did not want the targeted parent to accept that at face value\\.\n8\\. They expressed the belief that the targeted parent should have seen that the children were puppets\\, merely mouthing the words and performing the behaviors that they learned in order to maintain the relationship with the alienating parent\\.\u00a0In essence\\, they were asking the targeted parent to act as if there were 2 children: the alienating child going through the motions of the alienation AND the child who loved the targeted parent and never wanted to lose that relationship\\.\n9\\. The alienating parents were perceived as ruthless and utterly determined to undermine the relationship between them and the targeted parent\\.\u00a0Thus\\, many felt that the targeted parent should have tried harder and not given up\\.\n10\\. Many found out after the fact that the targeted parent had tried harder than they had known \\- court cases fought\\, letters and gifts they never received\\.\u00a0in most cases learning about these attempts had meaning\\.\u00a0\u00a0\n11\\. Even years later they were grateful to learn that the targeted parent had done more than they had known\\.\n\n***\n\n[Resources - click here for Google docs version that is easier to navigate](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QvwbNRH5VPUcbp1b3oI3DCsjB4Ax1d-bAZ6A6c6Qi4E)\nHere is a great 2-minute video by Amy J.

The below is by Brian H.:\n1.\u00a0Recognize and accept that your ex likely has personality disorder traits and that just about anything you say to them will be twisted and used against you with your children or the courts; so avoid nearly all contact with them as possible (avoid speaking, text and email are best.\u00a0Court-ordered use of OurFamilyWizard.com is a very helpful phone app.\n2.\u00a0Unfortunately, public awareness of parental alienation is very low.\u00a0Awareness is also low with most therapists and school personnel. While awareness of alienation situations is high for lawyers, judges, and Guardian Ad Litems (GALs), quite a few have some knowledge and want to intervene, but these are typically very complex cases and hard to sort out correctly; and also difficult to resolve. (However, all is not lost, there are specialized professionals that CAN help you.)\n3.\u00a0Parental alienation can be mild, moderate, and severe. Your situation is likely severe or moderate/severe if you are reading this now. These cases are complex medical situation that rarely gets the required medical input of a sub-specialist with specialized knowledge.\u00a0Parental alienation is very counterintuitive, which contributes to the how and why awareness with multiple professions is so low (and the worst part is they may THINK they are as knowledgeable as they need to be - which is wrong, which makes things even worse and costs you money, time, and the affections between you and your child/ren).\n4.\u00a0Do not blame your children or express anger at them for the incredibly hurtful things they do and say.\u00a0Their critical thinking skills have been suspended and they have been forced to align with what is analogous to being a cult leader (your ex).\u00a0\n5.\u00a0Leverage the links below to get the specialized education you need to help yourself and, ultimately, your children.\u00a0Included below are links for videos, websites, research papers, podcasts, and free monthly calls with top experts in the world on parental alienation.\n\n***\n\nFREE LEGAL PROCESS INFORMATION!

PA is the process, and the result, of psychological manipulation of a child into showing unwarranted fear, disrespect, or hostility towards a normative parent.\u00a0In severe cases, the manipulative parent seeks to sever a child's relationship with the targeted parent and seeks full custody.\n\n***\n\nTHIS SECTION HAS RESOURCES-ORIENTED PARENTS WITH \"ALL AGES / STAGES OF ALIENATION\":\u00a0\nA1.\u00a0Great website:[ http://www.targetedparent.com/school-partnerships](http://www.targetedparent.com/school-partnerships)\nA1a.\u00a0Specific steps and forms that parents can use with schools.\u00a0\nA1b.\u00a0A professionally written report that applies ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experiences) research on the effects of personality disordered parents raising (and alienating) children.\u00a0(The reason targeted parents should not stop trying to save their children by reunifying with them!)\nA2.\u00a0Awesome 21-minute PODCAST by reunification expert Karen Woodall (UK-based) taped for Christmas time 2017 to help alienated parents cope by hearing what alienated children have said caused their behavior and what they wanted the alienated parent to do.

Children never unreasonably reject the parent with whom they spend the most time\\.\n2\\. Children never unreasonably reject mothers\\.\n3\\. Each parent contributes equally to a child\u2019s alienation\\. \\(The alienator is the \"causation\" of all the issues\\)\n4\\. Alienation is a child\u2019s transient\\, short\\-lived response to the parents\u2019 separation\\.\n5\\. Rejecting a parent is a short\\-term healthy coping mechanism\\.\u00a0\\(BH \\- no\\, this is different\\)\n6\\. Young children living with an alienating parent need no intervention\\. \\(BH \\- the child is suffering from emotional and psychological abuse which results in long\\-term damage\\)\n7\\. Alienated adolescents\u2019 stated preferences should dominate custody decisions\\. \\(BH \\- the mind is under \"undue influence\" and they have diminished capacity\\)\n8\\. Children who appear to function well outside the family need no intervention\\.\u00a0\\(BH \\- their emotional and psychological damage is hidden\\)\n9\\. Severely alienated children are best treated with traditional therapy techniques while living primarily with their favored parent\\. \\(BH \\- these 1\\-hour per week therapies make your situation much worse\\, do not agree to these \\- even though you yearn to see your child\\!\\)\n10\\. Separating children from an alienating parent is traumatic \\(BH \\- this mainly refers to judges who hesitate to make a judgment for the only therapy that works for severe alienation; a court order of 90\\-day no\\-contact protective removal from the alienator which is best started with 4\\-days reunification treatment program\\. There are 2 excellent programs \\- Family Bridges which is national and Turning Points For Families \\- \"Therapeutic Vacation\" \\(conducted in NY with families from across the US\\)\\.\n\n***\n\nF.\u00a0If you are in - or are considering court processes; family law attorneys have increasingly encouraged hired support parenting and Custody Consultants that work with you \"behind-the-scenes\" for several purposes, including, but not limited to the following:\n\\- Helping formulate a case strategy\n\\- Reviewing another expert's work \\(reports\\); without testifying\n\\- Assisting in formulating direct examination and cross\\-examination questions\n\\- Identifying and assisting in retaining testimonial experts\n\\- Helping prepare witnesses\n\\- Providing expert information about an area\\, without testifying\n\\- Providing a review of relevant social science literature on factors at issue in a given case\n\\- Assisting with client education and client management\n(Source:\u00a0Forensic Psychology Consultation in Child Custody Litigation, A Handbook for Work Product Review, Case Preparation, and Expert Testimony copyright 2013 by Philip Stahl, Ph.D. and Robert Simon, Ph.D. and published by the American Bar Association)\nAdditional benefits of a parental alienation consultant:\n1)\u00a0By synthesizing the research and provides you with the specific information needed for you and your children's situation.\u00a0This includes hundreds of books and hours working with leading experts from around the world. this saves you time and provides you with guidance to the most relevant materials to help yourself.\n2)\u00a0Helps prevent comfort and relief of having the knowledge and a level of control of the situation.\u00a0This will allow you to reduce the number of days that you are out of work dealing with PA issues\n3)\u00a0Helps you save money by preventing you from selecting an attorney that does not have the specialized skills required to win custody in a parental alienation case.\u00a0Hiring the \"best\" attorney doesn't matter; what does matter is hiring an attorney with the highly specialized Parental Alienation skills, knowledge, and experience required to win custody.\na)\u00a0Many family attorneys truly believe their experiences negotiating parenting schedules will be enough for your case - that is a gross underestimation of what will happen in your case. DO NOT let an attorney downplay the significance of the differentiation of a PA case vs \"typical\" child custody cases.\u00a0your expert will give you specific questions to ask an attorney to determine if they have the qualifications required to save you and your children.\nb)\u00a0Many family law attorneys have very little trial experience, alienators are litigious and often act/perform well enough in trials to overcome the negative facts of their behavior, and their lack of emotional range gives them a \"calm, cool, and collected\" effect that enables them to fool/convince their attorney, therapists, and court staff that they (and the children) are victims from you!\u00a0\nc)\u00a0Fighting for custody (at least some parenting time) is expensive, but unless you invest in sub-specialist professionals, ALL your money will be wasted, so you should accept that you need to spend more money, but at least you have a much better chance to not have wasted all your money.\n4)\u00a0An expert does not give legal advice but complements the work that your attorney does (but at a lower rate) to help you anticipate and meet the various demands of your situation, such as selecting and organizing information that will be most useful.\u00a0Provides you with guidance through the many confusing aspects of being alienated, including how to present yourself. There are many things that can go wrong, and they often determine outcomes.\n5)\u00a0Helps you prepare for the custody evaluation, to anticipate the various components and goals of the evaluation, and help you avoid common pitfalls, such as being overly anxious or trying too hard.\n6)\u00a0Helps you avoid the alienator's devastating tactics that are too risky to post in this public forum but ask the expert you are considering.\n7)\u00a0Helps you protect the heart and mind of your child by guiding you to the right actions (with them and your ex).\u00a0Physical custody is only half the battle, you need to win the heart and minds of your children, and that requires specialized guidance due to these incredibly unique and challenging circumstances; alienation requires you do things that are often counterintuitive.\u00a0The alienator sets you up to make mistakes, and knowing how to avoid falling in those traps can save your relationship with your child.\n8)\u00a0Helps you with the knowledge and tools to try and maintain a connection with the child, which could result in you paying less child support or not losing the child support you receive.\u00a0Many judges will let children of about 13 and older decide which parent they want to live with. This is a very misguided decision, because alienated children have \"diminished capacity\" and have been \"unduly influenced\" and cannot make decisions that are \"in the child's best interests\" for their mental and physical health.\u00a0They are in survival mode and under the fear of psychological retaliation. Also, consider how making this decision places terrible guilt on them for disappointing a parent.\n9)\u00a0Helps you build a foundation for an eventual reconnection and speed that to happen sooner.\n\nG.\u00a0HOW TO FIGHT PARENTAL ALIENATION - adapted from [http://familyunity.com/](http://familyunity.com/)\na.\u00a0Find the rare expert that understands this phenomenon and can educate the court (your judge) on PA.\nb.\u00a0Make sure you only hire an attorney or GAL, expert witness or therapist, who is not intimidated by the court or status quo.\nc.\u00a0Do not leave the marital home when one party files for divorce as this will become the status quo and will hurt your chances to obtain joint custody.\nd.\u00a0Do not agree to go before any court evaluator that does not understand PAS or who is chosen by one side and not the other\ne.\u00a0If Guardian ad litem does not understand the phenomenon of parental alienation, ask that he/she be recused\nf.\u00a0Beware of any settlement negotiated by your attorney which does not give you equitable (equal) rights\nH.\u00a0REUNIFICATION DOCUMENTARY!!\u00a0The ERASING FAMILY documentary follows young adults fighting to reunite with their broken families.

If you have found this group through an internet search and this situation is happening to you and your child, please connect with us quickly because early intervention is critical!\u00a0Even though it is estimated to affect 22 million families in the US, this scientifically proven pathology has low public and even professional awareness. Unfortunately, the courts (judges and most staff), and nearly all lawyers are not knowledgeable about personality disorders, and they unwittingly make the wrong decisions.\u00a0Even 95% of therapists don't understand PA well enough to coach a Targeted Parent, but they can help you deal with the expected situational anxiety and depression you may have. Do not believe or accept any court or therapist's guidance to have an alienated child treated by a therapist, it NEVER works and usually makes things worse! (Unless it is with a nationally recognized expert).\u00a0Attempting the treatment (cited by Judges as a \"therapeutic intervention\") the child (or child and targeted parent) WILL nearly always result in catastrophic damage to their relationship.

That\u2019s because domestic abuse is about controlling someone\u2019s mind and emotions as much as hurting their body. Being abused can leave you scared and confused. It can be hard for you to see your partner\u2019s actions for what they really are. The abuse can creep up slowly. A putdown here or there. An odd excuse to keep you away from family or friends. Sometimes violence starts once you\u2019ve been cut off from other people. By then, you feel trapped. If you\u2019re afraid of your partner, that\u2019s a big red flag. You may be scared to say what you think, to bring up certain topics, or to say no to sex. No matter the reason, fear has no place in a healthy relationship.\nIf you feel like you\u2019re being abused, there\u2019s a good chance you may be, and it\u2019s worth getting help. Keep that in mind as you think about these signs:\n**Bullies threaten or control you:** Accuses you of having an affair, Blames you for abuse, Criticizes you. Tells you what to wear and how you should look, Threatens to kill you or someone close to you, Throws things or punches walls when angry, Yells at you and makes you feel small\n**Cuts you off from family and friends:** Keeps close tabs on where you go and whom you go with, Makes you ask for an OK to see friends and family, Embarrasses you in front of others, and it makes you want to avoid people\n**Physically abuses you:** Abandons you in a place you don\u2019t know, Keeps you from eating, sleeping, or getting medical care, Locks you in or out of your house, Punches, pushes, kicks, bites, pulls hair\n**Controls your money:** Keeps cash and credit cards from you, Puts you on an allowance and makes you explain every dollar you spend, Keeps you from working whatever job you want, Steals money from you or your friends, Won\u2019t let you have money for basic needs like food and clothes\n**Sexually abuses you:** Forces you to have sex, Makes you dress in a sexual way, Makes you feel like you owe them sex, Tries to give you an\u00a0[STD](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/default.htm), Won\u2019t use\u00a0[condoms](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-condoms)\u00a0or other\u00a0[birth control](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/)\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (1-800-799-7233).\n[https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-domestic-abuse-signs#2](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-domestic-abuse-signs#2)\n\n***\n\nThis 16-minute video from 2019 features Dr. Steven Miller, Linda Gottlieb, LCSW, LFMT, and Dr. Bill Bernet.\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&v=YQXSAVUNngg&feature=emb_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&v=YQXSAVUNngg&feature=emb_logo)",

At least partially from SURVIVAL and FAMILIARITY.\u00a0Our brains seek the safety of the familiar environments which can be the behaviors of the toxic parent we grew up with.\u00a0The good news is there are treatment modalities that will help you get better (the sooner the better, trauma feelings get more ingrained over time)!\n**THIS MEETUPS FORMAT:**\u00a0I commonly present research-based PSYCHOEDUCATION sessions that can TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE by ENABLING you with the information, knowledge, and motivation to take action to start gaining control over your distress towards overcoming the trauma you may not realize you suffered.\u00a0Learn why recovery can be hard and the steps available to prevent you from making the same mistakes again!\u00a0\"Toxic\" generally includes narcissistic, borderline, antisocial personality disorders (psychopathy/sociopathy).\n**THE NARCISSIST IN YOU LIFE book by Julie L.

I had figured out that narcissism was involved but not much more. The resources, thoughtful analysis, and discussions that took place at this Meetup group were instrumental in helping me move forward. The organizer/leader does a superb job selecting topics, gathering and sharing resources, and running the meetings.

Sandra's one year program is $33 per month.\u00a0(Unbiased recommendation, no affiliation or benefit to this Meetup Group.)\nSandra's research differentiates the types of trauma and each requires a different treatment to be effective:\n\\- 25% of survivors need treatment for their codependency traits of being overly compassionate\\, thinking about others' problems\\, anticipating their needs\\, and making excuses for others \\(learned during childhood\\)\\.\u00a0Treatment is to resolve a feeling of worthlessness and being awful to themselves and doubt their intuition and worry they are not being flexible enough\\.\u00a0\u00a0\n\\- 75% of survivors need treatment for \"Healing the Aftermath of the Pathological Love Relationship\" and to learn how to prevent a repeat relationship by learning to guard their \"super traits\" of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness that narcissists target\\.\u00a0Also\\, this profile often requires additional treatment for the cognitive\u00a0dissonance pain caused by their gaslighting and the fact that you had essentially 2 relationships \\- one with the abusers \"good\" Jekyll persona and another with the evil Hyde persona\\.\u00a0\n[https://pathologyedinstitute4rhr.com/courses/69/about?affiliate=a08588baf32c](https://pathologyedinstitute4rhr.com/courses/69/about?affiliate=a08588baf32c)\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 **Complex PTSD (CPTSD)** is typically from pernicious (slow, insidious) or repetitive trauma that includes child developmental trauma & abuse (often with insecure attachment too), child neglect, sex abuse, domestic violence, intimate partner coercive violence that affects our psyche and can take years for a full recovery.\u00a0Treatment options include Component-Based therapy (Hopper 2019)\n2.\u00a0**PTSD trauma** is typically singular event and can often be treated successfully within months using psychodynamic group therapy, hypnotherapy, and flooding (Hopper 2019)\u00a0\n3.\u00a0Abused Women Syndrome - refers more to physical violence and requires a different treatment for that abuse and trauma harm.\n\n***\n\n**Finding a therapist to treat you individually** (NOT marriage therapy with a Narcissist - this will most likely cause you more anguish).\u00a0The link below is excellent as most therapists advertise this database.\u00a0You can plug in your zip code, and your medical/mental health insurance brand (and there is a law that requires your insurance provider to include mental health coverage). Then select your \"Issue/s\". Relevant option examples include Codependence, Trauma, Narcissism (your partner's), Domestic Abuse,\u00a0Divorce,\u00a0and Self-esteem. Don't succumb to thinking there is a stigma to therapy, take advantage, and consider it as treating yourself to a brain

and priorities of a GOOD match therapist for YOU:\u00a0You feel listened to, safe, and that they really care about you.\u00a0They answer your questions without being defensive.\u00a0Do they come across as professional and only share information about themselves that is relevant to helping you.\u00a0For more ideas, watch Ross Rosenberg's therapist litmus test:\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90ik1hzX0xs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90ik1hzX0xs)\n\n***\n\n**CAUTION:\u00a0Never tell anyone that you think they are a narcissist**, have narcissistic traits, or have a narcissistic personality disorder.\u00a0Also, don't tell other people that you think this either (except your 1 or 2 closest friends or family members).\u00a0Somewhat surprisingly, it is hard to convince/educate people about the very real damage that narcissists cause; even with evidence - \"Until people experience the harm, it's hard for them to comprehend it, especially when they have only experienced the narcissist as charming.\"\u00a0\u00a0Narcissists have needed to learn how to be charming (even though, as you know, it is only superficial) and are only abusive to those close to them, so they have likely only experienced their charm or normalcy.\u00a0\nEspecially resist using any labels with any professionals you encounter!\u00a0Although using this label gets people's attention, a psychological phenomenon called \"SPONTANEOUS TRAIT ATTRIBUTION\" happens, which causes nearly all people to\u00a0think that YOU are the trait label you used!\u00a0Therefore they will view YOU\u00a0\nThis \"NOT LABELLING\" people guidance also applies to all other personality disorders such as Borderline Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder (known as a psychopath).\u00a0Even though people with these disorders can be harmful to you and others and you need to protect yourself.\u00a0You should still be respectful and have compassion for them, they did not choose to have this mental illness, likely were victims of trauma in their childhood (that only specialist professionals can treat, do not try yourself - establish strict boundaries instead).\u00a0\u00a0(Note:\u00a0While someone who is afflicted with a \"Bi-Polar disorder\" is NOT destructive to others like personality disorders can be and Bi-Polar disorder can be successfully regulated with commonly prescribed medications and talk therapy.)\n\n***\n\n**VIDEO:\u00a0Dr. Ramini:\u00a0\"The Empath and the Narcissist: a Dark Fairy Tale\"** As Dr. Ramini says, her story also applies to reversed gender roles.\u00a0If you are the adult child of a toxic parent, you could easily have developed to be an \"empath\" or \"codependent\" personality style (common, but not official clinical terms).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMXx5VlrMog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMXx5VlrMog)\n\n***\n\n**Note: We all have some mild narcissistic traits throughout our lives.**\u00a0 Narcissism is a valuable part of normal child and adolescent development.\u00a0However, when the traits continue into early adulthood, and a qualified clinician identifies them as having 5 of the 9 criteria in the DSM-5, then the clinician may be diagnosed with\u00a0\"Narcissistic Personality Disorder\" (NPD).\u00a0Labels like NPD are useful for training and understanding,\u00a0but since in the case of Narcissism it has severely negative interpersonal behavior connotations,\u00a0are regarded and intractable to treat, so many clinicians are reluctant to give this diagnosis.\n\n***\n\n**SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS when explaining your situation to family and friends** (I used a placeholder \"he\"\u00a0(could also be a \"she\") and \"XXXX\"):\n\"My mind and body are hurting and I've finally realized that it's mainly due to how I've allowed myself to be lied to, controlled, manipulated, and exploited by XXXX.\u00a0He has suffered in his life and now I've realized that he has a psychological issue that is driving him to be verbally and emotionally abusive to me.\u00a0I've read articles on the web that describe why he is so negative, hostile, and always putting people close to them down.\u00a0\u00a0In public with you and with most people, he does a great job of being charming and normal, that's part of what attracted me to him, but I now have realized that it is all a mask.\u00a0I'm recognizing how he has exploited me and many other people, he feels entitled, uncaring, and yet he always describes himself as a victim... after I read about it, his traits fit this problematic profile in many ways.\"\u00a0\n\"Despite all this, I still feel compassion for XXXX because the research explains how common it is for the trauma he suffered from his parents and family often results in this abusive form of behavior as an adult.\u00a0These traumas don't affect a person's intelligence and it actually increases their ability to be charming, and successful.\u00a0To describe their lack of being able to relate to others, one doctor uses a movie metaphor, that people like XXXX experience the world as if he/she is an actor and also direct all the other actors in a movie, and they become violent when the actors don't act as they direct them, which is to always meet their needs for admiration and to be served.\u00a0\u00a0I've learned that unfortunately for them and us, these conditions are very resistant to change, so I need to protect myself and our children from him.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Part of my journey back to health includes not allowing myself to be isolated so thank you for letting me share this with you.\u00a0I appreciate your friendship as I work to figure out what to do next.\"\u00a0\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u00a0\nBOOK 1:\u00a0Top selling and 4.5 rated: \"Healing from

It also describes a relationship that enables another person to maintain their irresponsible, addictive, or underachieving behavior.\nThe term\u00a0*codependency*\u00a0has been around for decades. Although it originally applied to spouses of alcoholics (first called co-alcoholics), researchers revealed that the characteristics of codependents were much more prevalent in the general population than had previously imagined. In fact, they found that if you were raised in a dysfunctional family or had an ill parent, you could also be codependent.\nResearchers also found that codependent symptoms got worse if left untreated. The good news is that they\u2019re reversible.\nSYMPTOMS OF CODEPENDENCY\u00a0\u00a0The following is a list of symptoms of codependency and being in a codependent relationship. You don\u2019t need to have them all to qualify as codependent.\n\u00a7\u00a0**Low self-esteem.**\u00a0Feeling that you\u2019re not good enough or comparing yourself to others.\u00a0Hidden from consciousness, are feelings of shame, guilt, and perfectionism\n\u00a7\u00a0**People-pleasing.**\u00a0Saying \u201cNo\u201d causes them\u00a0[anxiety](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/). Some codependents They go out of their way and sacrifice their own needs to accommodate other people.\n\u00a7\u00a0\\*\\*Poor boundaries.\\*\\*Boundaries that are weak or blurry your feelings, thoughts, and needs plus your body, money, and belongings.\u00a0\n\u00a7\u00a0**Reactivity.** If someone says something you disagree with, you either believe it or become defensive.\n\u00a7\u00a0**Caretaking.**\u00a0If someone else has a problem, you want to help them to the point that you give up yourself. It\u2019s natural to feel empathy but codependents need to help others and might feel rejected if another person doesn\u2019t want help.\n\u00a7\u00a0**Control.**\u00a0Control helps codependents feel safe and secure. Sometimes they have an addiction that either helps them loosen up, like alcoholism, or helps them hold their feelings down, like workaholism so that they don\u2019t feel out of control. People-pleasing and care-taking can be used to control and manipulate people. Alternatively, codependents are bossy and tell you what you should or shouldn\u2019t do. This is a violation of someone else\u2019s boundary.\n\u00a7\u00a0**Dysfunctional communication.**\u00a0Codependents have trouble when it comes to communicating their thoughts, feelings, and needs. Instead of saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d you might pretend that it\u2019s okay or tell someone what to do.\n\u00a7\u00a0**Obsessions.**\u00a0Codependents have a tendency to spend their time thinking about other people or relationships. This is caused by their dependency and anxieties and fears.\n\u00a7\u00a0**Dependency.**\u00a0Codependents need other people to like them to feel okay about themselves. They\u2019re afraid of being rejected or abandoned, even if they can function on their own. Others need always to be in a relationship because they feel depressed or lonely when they\u2019re by themselves for too long. This trait makes it hard for them to end a relationship, even when the relationship is painful or abusive. They end up feeling trapped.\n\u00a7\u00a0**Denial.**\u00a0One of the problems people face in getting help for codependency is that they\u2019re in denial about it, meaning that they don\u2019t face their problem. Usually, they think the problem is someone else or the situation.\u00a0\u00a0Codependents also deny their feelings and needs. They might be in denial of their need for space and autonomy. Although some codependents seem needy, others act like they\u2019re self-sufficient when it comes to needing help. They won\u2019t reach out and have trouble receiving. They are in denial of their vulnerability and need for love and intimacy.\n\u00a7\u00a0**Problems with intimacy.**\u00a0By this, I\u2019m not referring to sex, although sexual dysfunction often is a reflection of an intimacy problem. I\u2019m talking about being open and close with someone in an intimate relationship. Because of the shame and weak boundaries, you might fear that you\u2019ll be judged, rejected, or left.\n\u00a7\u00a0**Painful emotions.**\u00a0Codependency creates stress and leads to painful emotions. Shame and low self-esteem create anxiety and fear about being judged, rejected or abandoned; making mistakes; being a failure; feeling trapped by being close or being alone. The other symptoms lead to feelings of anger and resentment,\u00a0[depression](https://psychcentral.com/depression/), hopelessness, and despair. When the feelings are too much, you can feel numb.\nThere is help for recovery and change for people who are codependent. The first step is getting guidance and support. These symptoms are deeply ingrained habits and difficult to identify and change on your own. Work on becoming more assertive and building your self-esteem.\n\n***\n\n**How do you spot a narcissist?**\u00a0 (Source:\u00a0Adapted from Bill Eddy, LICSW & Attorney)\nThe \"WEB\" Method:\u00a0Their WORDS, Your Emotions (Gut Feeling), Their Actions:\n**A.\u00a0THEIR WORDS:**\n1.\u00a0Do they often speak about others either disparagingly and only occasionally positively (and then its extra positive and not often in the middle)?\u00a0\n2.\u00a0Do they always turn the conversation back to themselves, and looked bored when you are talking?\u00a0(The\u00a0\n3.\u00a0Are they perpetually describing themselves as a victim in many ways while also referring to themselves as superior?\u00a0\n**B.\u00a0YOUR EMOTIONS (you gut feelings):**\n1.\u00a0How do they make you feel?\u00a0Don't ignore your gut feelings.\u00a0\n2.\u00a0Too good to be true - it likely is.\u00a0\n3.\u00a0Do you feel stupid, inadequate, and like you can't breathe?\n**C.\u00a0THEIR BEHAVIOR:**\u00a0\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Take notice of what they do, more than what they say (the words are a distraction from their bad behavior).\n2.\u00a0Do they disregard your requests?\u00a0(This is because they like winning relationships, not having relationships).\n3.\u00a0When they mess up, do they blame you?\u00a0This is called projection.\u00a0(They are always a victim.)\n4.\u00a0They always defend themselves, including writing long email rants and engaging in social media meltdowns.\n5.\u00a0The 90% rule.\u00a0Do they do something (or many things) that 90% of people would NEVER do?\u00a0\u00a0Examples could include humiliating a partner or child in public, sabotaging someone, verbally attacking a colleague or employee in a meeting, etc.\u00a0\n**Additional ways to identify a narcissist (compiled from multiple sources):**\u00a0\n6.\u00a0Be wary of someone who doesn't have many active long-term friendships.\u00a0Determine if there is dysfunction in their family.\u00a0Family estrangements could be the result of narcissism (which leaves a wake of destruction for all people close to them).\u00a0\u00a0\n7.\u00a0Tell them you don't want to do something they want to do.\u00a0A narcissist will often react with significant discomfort or even worse - an angry outburst.\u00a0(They view you as an object and are insulted that you are in control in any way.)\n8.\u00a0Ask them, \"In what areas of your life or character would you like to improve?\" and observe their baffled expression - narcissists think they are perfect and will only refer to something that is external to themselves.\n9\\.

That\u2019s because domestic abuse is about controlling someone\u2019s mind and emotions as much as hurting their body. Being abused can leave you mentally scared and confused. It can be hard for you to see your partner\u2019s actions for what they really are. The abuse can creep up slowly and continue subtlety. A verbal putdown here or there. An odd excuse to keep you away from family or friends. Sometimes they wait to be violent only after you\u2019ve been cut off from other people so you feel trapped. If you\u2019re afraid of your partner, that\u2019s a big red flag. You may be scared to say what you think, to bring up certain topics, or to say no to sex. No matter the reason, fear has no place in a healthy relationship.\nIf you feel like you\u2019re being abused, there\u2019s a good chance you are, and it\u2019s worth getting help.\n**Keep that in mind as you think about these signs:**\n**Bully, threaten, or control you:** Accuses you of having an affair, Blames you for abuse, Criticizes you. Tells you what to wear and how you should look, Threatens to kill you or someone close to you, Throws things or punches walls when angry, Yells at you, and makes you feel small\n**Cuts you off from family and friends:** Keeps close tabs on where you go and whom you go with, Makes you ask for an OK to see friends and family, Embarrasses you in front of others, and it makes you want to avoid people\n**Physically abuses you:** Abandons you in a place you don\u2019t know, Keeps you from eating, sleeping, or getting medical care, Locks you in or out of your house, Punches, pushes, kicks, bites, pulls hair\n**Controls your money:** Keeps cash and credit cards from you, Puts you on an allowance and makes you explain every dollar you spend, Keeps you from working whatever job you want, Steals money from you or your friends, Won\u2019t let you have money for basic needs like food and clothes\n**Sexually abuses you:** Forces you to have sex, Makes you dress in a sexual way, Makes you feel like you owe them sex, Tries to give you an\u00a0[STD](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/default.htm), Won\u2019t use\u00a0[condoms](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/birth-control-condoms)\u00a0or other\u00a0[birth control](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/)\n**National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (1-800-799-7233).**\n[https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-domestic-abuse-signs#2](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-domestic-abuse-signs#2)\n**Meghan Markle provides a full-view educational example of narcissistic behavior.**\u00a0 Our **healing** opportunity is to **reduce any shame** you may feel about your situation.\u00a0Narcissism is so poorly understood, neither Harry nor the royal family could protect him from a narcissist initially or succeed in helping him to break away from Meghan once her voluminous narcissist behaviors were on display in plain sight.\u00a0(Meghan likely felt some loss of control coming and then facilities their move to isolation, first to Canada and now to Santa Barbara, CA - the familiar US for Meghan.)\u00a0\u00a0\n**The Oprah interview\u00a0on March 7, 2021**, provides an **easily digestible view of how a narcissist thinks** and speaks.\u00a0Megan's control of Harry, entitlement, exploitation, lack of emotional empathy, grandiosity (this interview itself, which Meghan did without Harry for more than the first half).\u00a0All these behaviors take place in an unconscious (unknowingly) instinctive manner (her manipulations just come to her naturally, she has no specific awareness of them being different than typical societal behavior).\u00a0Megan is not acting, she is an example of displaying her sincere but delusional beliefs that she is a victim of the royal family, the media, her father/sister, everyone!\u00a0Meghan is in a stage of idolizing Harry (at the end of the interview she skillfully attributes their \"escape\" to him); unfortunately, a pattern of de-valuation will likely come in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\n**What made Harry susceptible?**\u00a0It is highly speculated that Princess Diana was unfortunately afflicted with a borderline personality disorder (likely developed from her parent's rejection and banishment to a boarding school).\u00a0Prince Charles was not a very nurturing father.\u00a0Diana (who died when Harry was 12), developed his \"people-pleasing\" personality style and was familiar with relationship instability.\u00a0Prince Harry described Diana as a mother who \u201csmothered us with love\u201d: \u201cShe would just engulf you and squeeze you as tight as possible. And being as short as I was then, there was no escape, you were there and you were there for as long as she wanted to hold you\u2026 All I can hear is her laugh in my head and that sort of crazy laugh of where there was just pure happiness shown on her face.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n**I found the best YouTube video to educate you is from HG Tudor** (A self-proclaimed narcissist-psychopath himself).\u00a0HG had created a series of 17 short videos on Meghan BEFORE March 7, 2021 (you can back to watch them learn about all her previous behaviors.\u00a0I suggest you what the HG Tudor video first, before watching the CBS interview.\u00a0\u00a0HG Tudor's Meghan video 18 AFTER the interview\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kFP3BGeJgY&t=186s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kFP3BGeJgY&t=186s)\n**Oprah's CBS interview video** is 1:25 long and here is that CBS link.\u00a0\u00a0[https://www.cbs.com/shows/oprah-with-meghan-and-harry-a-cbs-primetime-special/video/i6UW_WTQjLrEeOoObMmlwrFLTTypvuZm/cbs-presents-oprah-with-meghan-and-harry-a-primetime-special/#main-container](https://www.cbs.com/shows/oprah-with-meghan-and-harry-a-cbs-primetime-special/video/i6UW_WTQjLrEeOoObMmlwrFLTTypvuZm/cbs-presents-oprah-with-meghan-and-harry-a-primetime-special/#main-container)",

Led by Senegalese native Mamadou Diop, MAMADOU is an eclectic group of musicians who have truly formed a guitar and drum led sound that is all their own (enough to win a Boston Music Award as well as be nominated 4 times). The music they produce is made for dance, and drumming and percussion are integrated into their live shows, getting the audience to move their feet to the beat! The best way to appreciate MAMADOU is to experience their performance LIVE. With lyrics sung in several languages, the positive messages of the ensemble are conveyed through the universal language of music. If you like to dance, enjoy quality live music, or are just looking for something different, then you'll want to join this group.</p>",

        "description": "Scenic Kayaking . . .\nas in kayaking the scenic rivers, lakes and coastal routes of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island\u00a0and Maine . . .\n\nThis kayak group is for advanced beginner, or intermediate to advanced paddlers who can paddle a distance averaging 6-8 miles or more (at an average paddle speed of 2-3 miles per hour) This group for persons over 21 years old and older.\n\nKayak gear: we encourage members to have a Kayak as there are few chances to rent kayaks at our events. Kayaks need to be a a\u00a0minimum length of 10 feet or longer,\u00a0no folding kayaks, and no inflatable kayaks, or sit-on-top or peddling kayaks allowed.\n\nOur plan is to schedule a kayak meet-up every week (weather permitting) during the kayak season, and in the summer months\u00a0to include some extra kayak events on Fridays(or a week day) as well. Kayak season is from May to October.\n\n**Only those with a clear, updated photo showing\u00a0their face (no sunglasses, hat, ski goggles, too far in the distance, other people in the photo,\u00a0or photo too dark) will be approved to join the group.This is so we will recognize you at the meetup events,\u00a0and, show(unhide) your meet up interests and groups\u00a0(click on \u201cunhide your interests and groups\u00a0from others\u201d in your Profiles section).**\n\n**Per club policy,** no pets allowed, and no guests please. Have your guest join the meet-up group (and be approved ) so that they can agree to the liability release and attend an event.\n\n**Where we paddle**: The meetup locations will primarily be within a two hour driving range (North/South/East/West) from the vicinity of the Boston area.\n\n**Kayak Gear:** We recommend you bring your own kayak and related gear, as most of our paddle events do not have kayak rentals on site). You can also rent a Kayak for the day (from EMS or Charles River Canoe and Kayak). Wearing a Coast guard approved PFD on all kayak events is required. **No sit-on-top\u00a0or inflatable or folding kayaks allowed.**\n\n**Meet-up costs:**\u00a0We do not charge member fees, nor do we have\u00a0sponsors (yet)\u00a0who help pay\u00a0the organizer\u2019s meetup\u2019s annual fee (which runs about $205 a year). However, if members would like to help contribute towards the cost of the organizers annual fee to meetup.com, we will cheerfully accept voluntary donations.\u00a0To donate:\u00a0We accept cash at the event, or you can make a donation\u00a0via Paypal.\u00a0If using Paypal\u00a0the email address is\u00a0Heidi1225@comcast.net\n\n**Membership Perks:** As a way of saying Thank You to those members who donate $10 or\u00a0more\u00a0\u00a0for the kayak season, we are offering the following perks: If an event is full, whoever\u2019s first on the wait list who has made a seasonal donation of $10 or more, gets automatically moved up to the RSVP list. With a maximum of 2 donors per event getting to move ahead\u00a0(Applicable up to 48 hours before the event date). This perk is valid for each and every event throughout the season (Kayak season runs from May to October).\u00a0\n\n**Wait list Queue;** members who have made a donation to the group are given priority when being moved up to the RSVP list. In addition; to ensure the safety of the group, (and based on the\u00a0member ratio of the event), the event host has the discretion\u00a0at times to prioritize which members get moved up from the waitlist (rather than the waitlist queue being based on date/ time that the member is on the waitlist).\n\nDonations are nonrefundable, and will remain with the group and only be used to fund annual organizer\u2019s meetup.com fees or for the groups safety gear, etc. \n\n**PLEASE DO NOT DISCUSS POLITICS** as we have members with all kinds of strong opinions - this is not the place for that.\u00a0Be courteous to everyone and the\u00a0Organizers who take the effort to list events.\n**Other:** Generally, everyone is responsible for carrying /portaging their own kayak to and from the water (unless other people offer to help).\u00a0Note; its not fair to expect people to randomly help.\nEntire inactivity of more than 1 year (not even visiting our page once a year sitting at home!) may lead to exclusion of your membership.\n\n**The importance of keeping this a friendly and healthy united group when doing activities together:**\nMembers are expected to be civil,\u00a0show respect and dignity to fellow members, and to follow our safety guidelines (note; if a member doesn\u2019t show good behavior or if the person is not healthy emotionally, and it\u2019s consistent (chronic, not acute), then this group is not a good fit for them).\n\nWe are also open to any kayak meetup ideas that you might be interested in. We look forward to having fun and meeting you all!\n\n**ACCIDENT WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY**\nParticipation in any Scenic Kayakers event implies that you have read, understand, and agree with our ACCIDENT WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY. Per the Electronic Records and Signatures in Commerce Act, Public Law 106-229 by joining this group, you agree to all the terms listed.\nI certify that I am physically fit and prepared for participation in an event and have not been advised otherwise by a qualified medical professional.\nI acknowledge awareness of the risks, foreseen and unforeseen, which are inherent in each event/activity. These inherent risks include, but are not limited to, serious personal injury, property damage, and death from participation in or travel to and from the event.\nScenic kayakers and its organizers do not, in any way, claim to be professionals or otherwise licensed, certified, trained, etc. to provide any service including emergency medical procedures.\nAS A CONDITION OF ATTENDING and JOINING THIS MEETUP, I AGREE to WAIVE, DISCHARGE CLAIMS, AND RELEASE FROM LIABILITY (Meet up.com, the Scenic Kayak Meet-up Group, its organizers, co-organizers, assistant organizers, trip leaders and event planners, as well as their families from any and all liability on account of, or in any way resulting from injuries, personal or property, losses, costs, damages, disability or death resulting from participating in or traveling to or from the activity.

        "description": "Welcome journeyers and lightworkers!\n\nThe Tree of Light, Roots of Peace meetup group is a sacred meeting space, with the intention to create more inner space and awaken creative inspiration, and to deepen our sense of homecoming within ourselves and with our beautiful Earth... Most of our events take place in Stoughton, MA, indoors and outdoors (including the annual Women Rise event) or the greater Boston area. We offer many wonderful opportunities to get connected with yourself, your creativity, and the natural world in a community of like-minded souls.\n\nThis group is for you if you are interested in: \\\n\nLearning to meditate \\\n\nBecoming more aware of your intuition and inner world \\\n\nBringing your current meditation practice to a deeper level \\\n\nDiving deep, healing old traumas, & being fully embodied in a safe and loving space \\\n\nExpressing the joy that is You in a loving, supportive community \\\n\nSacred Women's Circles and Sisterhood \\\n\nExperiencing the healing power of Sound \\\n\nExploring your Creativity through different art mediums \\\n\nJournaling as a transformative experience \\\n\nConnecting to the natural world through meditation and QiGong \\\n\nThe power of Sound healing combined with Yoga and other modalities \\\n\n...and other paths to deepening our joy in the human experience\n\nIf any of these resonate with you, or you feel a pull or curiosity, we'd love to have you join us!\n\nThe Tree of Light, Roots of Peace meetup group was created by Lydia Erickson as a way to share her sound healing, creative arts, and meditation classes in the Boston South Shore area, and to create a beautiful community. You can read more about her journey here and how Tree of Light, Roots of Peace was born: songofthetrees.com\n\n\"Tree of Light\" honors our physical and spiritual connection with the natural world, and \"Roots of Peace\" illustrates what happens to a world when the people honor their innate light and consciousness and reclaim their birthright of wholeness and connection to the Earth. The intention beneath healing the self is two-fold, for a release of trauma and a deepening of self-love is also healing to the Earth and life as a whole. To heal our Earth we must heal ourselves, which means staying on the path of growth, following our intuition, and awakening our creative abilities.\n\nWishing You a Blessed Day!",

The majority of our trips are small groups of 8-24 and include activities such as hiking, biking, kayaking, SUP, snorkeling, diving, etc. All skill levels are welcome!</p>\n<p>Solo travelers are welcome. If desired, we will attempt to match you with a same sex roommate. If not, solo supplements will vary depending on trip specifics.</p>\n<p>Benefitting the communities we visit is a core value, so many of our trips will use small, locally owned businesses. Supporting local entrepreneurs and small businesses strengthens communities, raises the overall quality of life, and ensures that the places we love will continue to be loved. This doesn't mean we will be \"roughing it\" though - expect 3-4.5-star accommodations.</p>\n<p>If a trip we're hosting is of interest to you, please rsvp \"yes\" on the Meetup page. It just means that you'd like more information -- it is not an obligation to go</p>\n<p>Join us to explore and have fun!</p>\n<p>Indemity Agreement: By joining our meetup group you agree to hold Beyond the Beaten Path, its organizers and its vendors free from liability or responsibility what so ever with regard to any negligent or intentional conduct of any third party including but not limited to Tour Company, Property Owners, etc. resulting in the loss of personal property, physical injury, monetary loss with regard to an event/meetup.

        "description": "<p>We are looking for people who are interested in learning about the restoration, renovation, and programming of the Lowell Mason House Music Center, the 1792 birthplace of Lowell Mason in Medfield, Massachusetts. Music educators, church musicians, and fans of American/New England history and historic preservation from around the country should consider joining as well as anyone in the local Medfield and or Greater Boston communities who will directly benefit from the programming opportunities that are created. Those who would like to help with the physical restoration and/or maintenance of the house, support the fund-raising initiatives, and those who would be like to act as docents or guides for the house, are encouraged to join as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lowell Mason (1792-1872) is best known as the founder of American school music education. His work as a pioneer music educator, first at the Boston Academy of Music which he co-founded in 1833 with George James Webb and soon after in the Boston public schools, where he taught for over twenty years, is one of his greatest historical legacies. He also also known as a pioneer composer of American sacred music as he wrote, arranged, and published many hymns and sacred music collections. The Lowell Mason House was founded in October of 2010 when a group of concerned Medfield citizens and music educators from around the country came together with the desire to preserve the house and legacy of Lowell Mason the Father of Music Education in America. Within months we generated enough support and organized to secure a new location for the house and move it before demolition by a local developer to town owned land next to Hinckley Pond.</p>\n<p>The Mission of the Lowell Mason House is to create and program an active space for music making, music and arts education advocacy and historical preservation within the original structure of the Lowell Mason birthplace.</p>\n<p>The Lowell Mason House will be a major cultural hub. It will serve as a museum honoring Lowell Mason, while advocating for the importance of music education, and offer a diverse selection of music instruction and performance in facilities that encourage artistic expression and strengthen the value of the arts in the community.</p>",

Mostly we just like to get together and have fun! We have anime nights, gaming nights, movie nights, costume parties, etc. and do public events such as conventions, Renaissance Faires, museums and picnics. If you live in the MetroWest/Greater Boston area and want to meet people with similar interests, then join our group and come to an event!</p>\n<p><b>Group Rules</b>:</p>\n<p>Be respectful and courteous of your fellow group members. This includes using polite behavior as well as exercising proper hygiene :).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Harassment and abuse of any kind is not tolerated</b> and may get you removed from the group at the Organizer's discretion. All harassment and abuse should be reported to the Organizer (Emily Renauld) as soon as it happens. <br></p>\n<p><b>Please note that we are not a singles group! </b>Of course, it is inevitable people will meet and fall in love in this group, but we are primarily here to make friends and share activities and interests with each other. Please don't expect to meet your soul mate or \"hook up\" with people. Treat everyone, regardless of gender or relationship status, with respect! <br></p>\n<p><b>You must be able to provide your own transportation. </b>We realize that not everyone has a car, but please make sure ahead of time that you have a ride to and from all events. Event hosts and other members are not responsible for providing transportation to other members to or from events. <br></p>\n<p>Only RSVP to an event if you are able to attend. <b>Three \"no shows\" will get you removed from the group</b>. Telling an event organizer or host in advance that you will not be able to make it will not count against you. For events that require planning for a specific number of people, or for events that are full, you should give at least 24 hours notice if you can no longer attend. Giving less than 24 hours notice may count as a \"no show\" at the event organizer's discretion. Illness or other legitimate reasons are an exception. <br></p>\n<p>Please read event descriptions carefully! If an event host says to bring food, drink or cash to pitch in, you are expected to follow through. If an event gives a deadline to back out, you should adhere to that or expect to incur a \"no show.\" <br></p>\n<p><b>We only accept members who are 21+</b>. The age range for our meetup members is 20's and 30's. If we discover that you are not 21, you will be removed from the group. <br></p>\n<p><b>All members are required to have one personal photo (a picture of their face) in their profile photo file</b>. We will turn down applications with no picture or pictures with non-visible faces. <br></p>\n<p>You're expected to have a name that you go by as part of your meetup profile. This is for safety purposes as well as to help event organizers mark your attendance correctly. A first name or nickname is fine. <br></p>\n<p>You're expected to remain active in the meetup group. This means you should visit the page at least once per month or so to check out what events we've got going on. <b>We will remove any members who have been inactive for 6 months.&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p>A part of being in the meetup group is receiving communications from organizers. These are typically important updates and you are expected to read them. If you feel you are getting too many e-mails from Meetup itself, you may adjust your e-mail settings on the meetup page (this is not something that we can control). <br></p>\n<p>You can e-mail me at any point through the e-mail on my profile page. <br></p>\n<p>***PLEASE READ THIS ACCIDENT WAIVER OF RELEASE OF LIABILITY AS IT APPLIES TO ANYONE WHO PARTICIPATES IN ANY HAPPY GEEKS OF GREATER BOSTON EVENT, ACTIVITY, OR POST.***</p>\n<p><b>ACCIDENT WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY FORM</b></p>\n<p>BY AGREEING TO AN ACCEPTANCE IN BECOMING A MEMBER OF HAPPY GEEKS OF GREATER BOSTON YOU ARE AGREEING TO ABIDE BY THIS DISCLAIMER.

        "description": "This is a collective of people who share a passion for night and long exposure photography.\n\nThis Meetup is about gathering in groups, small or large, to capture the night and share the outcome with each other. Online events for image studies, goals review, training, as well as self-assigned challenges round out the program. Education, respectful and constructive feedback, exhibition of images and socializing during and after our gatherings are all part of our activities.\n\nWe explore old, new, popular and exotic places in the greater Boston area, southern New Hampshire and Maine, Rhode Island, northern Connecticut and central Massachusetts and there are occasional field trips to places such as New York or Maine. Inner city nightscapes are as much part of our portfolio, as will be dark sky star, astro-landscape and Milky Way shoots or light painting opportunities.\n\nThe group was founded in 2013 and has been active continuously. We average roughly one event every week, and we even keep it alive throughout the winter. Photo shoots are most frequent, but we also have online lectures, individual challenges, conferences and public events and paid excursions. Browse our hundreds of \"past meetups\" to see what we have been doing.\n\nMost standard meetups are free, membership dues will cover Meetup.com costs, minor group expenses and promotional means, invited lectures and trip organization expenses. There are also some paid events, as announced in those meetups, to provide services to learn from professionals in smaller groups with formal instructions, or to cover venue costs. You can sign up for this group for free and see if this is for you during the one month trial. If you pay right away, you still get 13 months of membership.\n\nNight photography is exciting, presents the world in a truly different light and is serene and calming in many ways. However, it is also very different from daytime shooting, sometimes physically taxing and requires to watch out for yourself and others. All our meetups are conducted with adult and mature members, who provide safety through numbers, but you will always be responsible for your own safety.\n\nWe are looking forward to seizing the night with you!\nJ\u00fcrgen, GBNP Organizer\nFind me online at [https://LinkTr.ee/JMLobert/](https://LinkTr.ee/JMLobert/)",

You do not have to own a motorcycle to join, only have the desire to be part of a friendly group that has a passion for motorcycle riding.</p>\n<p>Please review our <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/MetrowestRiders/about/\">About</a> page to see important details which will help you decide if you would like to join our group: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/MetrowestRiders/about/\">http://www.meetup.com/MetrowestRiders/about/</a>.</p>\n<p>Our rides vary from 10's to hundreds of miles, half-day to full-day trips, some have early kick-stands-up (KSU) time, other rides start later. The rides encompass many different road types and vistas. Some rides are planned and posted well in advance, and this group also serves as a great way to find riding companions for spontaneous and last-minute rides. Please feel free to use the Discussion Board to connect with other riders.</p>\n<p>We hope you will join us.</p>\n<p>Please post a recent portrait-type photograph of yourself so that we know what you look like and can identify you when you are meeting up for a group ride.</p>\n<p>Have fun, be safe, and keep the shiny side up!</p>",

        "description": "South of Boston Board Game Group was created to build an inclusive community of board gamers in the South Shore area and beyond. Our goal is to bring people together to share their love of board games in a welcoming and friendly environment. This is not a dating group, but a group where people can explore many different types of board games with many different types of people.\nWe play a variety of modern strategic board games \u2013 Euro, cooperative, social deduction, area control, filler, roll and write \u2013 you name it! We\u2019re a casual and respectful group that\u2019s low on conflict and big on good-natured fun. Love all those new board games? Great, so do we!\n\nSo what do we mean by modern strategic board games? You won\u2019t find games like Apples to Apples, Uno, Scrabble, or Monopoly here. We focus on games that make you think and plan ahead, often while juggling a whole bunch of possibilities and rules in your head. Some examples of games we\u2019ve recently played are Century: Spice Road, Azul, Dead of Winter, Mysterium, Pandemic, Firefly, 7 Wonders, Verflixxt, Decrypto, Ganz sch\u00f6n clever, and Bohnanza. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know any of those games \u2013 we welcome newcomers, and most weeks we\u2019ll be learning at least one new game ourselves. Everyone is welcome to bring games from home, or just show up and play whatever ends up on the table!\n\n**Group Guidelines (aka \u201cLet\u2019s make it awesome for everyone!\u201d)**\nTo ensure a great experience for everyone, we have some guidelines for group members:\nGeneral\n\n> \u2022\u00a0The best rule to follow is help others have a good time. The second best rule to follow is the golden rule. Between those two everyone should have a great time!\n\nCode of Conduct\n\n> \u2022\u00a0Our full code of conduct is posted below these guidelines. The short version: Our top priority is to create a safe and inclusive gaming experience where everyone feels welcome. Harassment, discrimination, disrespect, or general uncoolness toward others will not be tolerated.\n\nVenues\n\u2022\u00a0We meet in public spaces, and leave them in the same (or better) shape than we found them.\n\u2022\u00a0If you can afford it, patronize the establishments where we meet. They rely on people like us to stay in business!\nSportsmanship\n\n> \u2022\u00a0We\u2019re here to play games and have fun. Win graciously, lose graciously, and celebrate when others play well.\n\nRSVP & Attendance\n\n> \u2022\u00a0RSVP if you plan to attend so we know how many people to expect. Some venues may have limited space, so please change your RSVP if you can no longer attend.\n\n> \u2022\u00a0Arriving late is no problem, as long as you\u2019re willing to wait patiently for the next game to start. Some of our games take two hours or longer \u2013 if you arrive late, be prepared to wait a while!\n\n\n**Code of Conduct**\nOur top priority is to create a safe and inclusive gaming experience where everyone feels welcome no matter their gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, cognitive style, race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, or life choices. As part of this, group members agree to use the preferred pronouns of others (she/her, they/them, etc.).\u00a0Harassment, discrimination, disrespect, or general uncoolness toward others will not be tolerated.\nHarassment includes offensive verbal or written comments, sexual language or imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of games or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.\nSouth of Boston Board Game Group is not a singles group or dating group. People join our group to play board games, not to be hit on, and a refusal is awkward for everyone. Our message to group members is this: don\u2019t join our group because you want to flirt or ask people out. That type of behavior drives too many people \u2013 especially women \u2013 out of game groups. We take unwelcome attention seriously.\nIf a group member engages in harassing or disruptive behavior, the group organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or removing them from the meetup group. Group members who are asked to stop an unwanted behavior, whether intentional or unintentional, are expected to do so immediately so that everyone can get back to enjoying games. Arguing about the situation will not help.\nIf you are being harassed, or observe behavior that makes you uncomfortable, or have any other concerns, please alert one of the organizers immediately.",
